DRL Team AI R&D Center 14 Jan 2025 18 min read Content Intro Types and Applications of Reinforcement Learning by Industry Reinforcement Learning Innovation Landscape VC funding of RL Startups M&A activity in RL Remaining Challenges Introduction Machine Learning broadly encompasses three categories: Supervised, Unsupervised, and Reinforcement Learning. Reinforcement Learning (RL) is a type of ML in which an agent learns how to make decisions by interacting with an environment to achieve a specific goal. It replicates the trial-and-error learning process humans use to accomplish their goals. The agent's objective is to maximize a cumulative reward over time. Unlike supervised learning, RL does not rely on a training dataset but learns from feedback that evaluates performance without predefined behavioral targets. This dynamic learning process has enabled RL to excel in areas requiring sequential decision-making, from robotics to financial modeling. In essence, RL enables the creation of intelligent agents, which are computer programs capable of making decisions. Reinforcement learning, similar to how humans learn, is especially effective in uncertain and complex environments. The global market for RL technologies, is growing rapidly. In fact, according to industry reports , it was over $52B in 2024 and is projected to reach $32T by 2037, growing at around 65%+ CAGR during 2025 – 2037. In 2025 the industry size of RL is assessed at $122+B. Its applications span robotics, autonomous vehicles, supply chain optimization, healthcare, and gaming, with use cases expanding as the technology matures. Types and Applications of Reinforcement Learning by Industry RL is broadly categorized into three main types: value-based, policy-based, and model-based methods. Value-based approaches, such as Q-learning, focus on estimating the value of actions to determine the best policy indirectly. Policy-based methods, like Policy Gradient, directly optimize the policy itself, making them suitable for high-dimensional action spaces. Model-based RL incorporates an internal model of the environment, enabling agents to plan and simulate outcomes before acting. These diverse methodologies equip RL with the flexibility to tackle a wide range of real-world problems. For instance, deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has advanced the field by integrating deep learning techniques with RL algorithms. Leveraging the representational power of neural networks, DRL allows agents to process high-dimensional input data, such as images and complex sensor readings. Techniques like Deep Q-Networks (DQN) and Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) have demonstrated exceptional performance in environments as varied as video games and autonomous driving. Prominent companies are already leveraging RL to power products and services. To give you some examples of RL applications already available today: Tesla employs RL in its autopilot system to enable real-time decision-making for autonomous vehicles. SpaceX has used RL to improve the precision of rocket landings, a critical component of its reusable rocket technology. A SpaceX Super Heavy booster rocket successfully returned to Earth and was caught by giant robotic arms, marking the first attempt to recover the 232-foot booster at the launch tower after supporting the reusable Starship spacecraft's launch. In gaming, companies like DeepMind have utilized RL to create AI agents that outperform human players in complex games like StarCraft II. ChatGPT uses Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) to align its responses with user preferences. After pretraining on vast datasets, RLHF refines the model by leveraging human feedback to train a reward model and optimize response quality through reinforcement learning techniques like Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO). Your smart robot vacuum avoids obstacles by receiving feedback from its environment and adapting its behavior to prevent collisions with walls, furniture, or stairs. These examples underscore RL's impact, positioning it at the heart of future technological progress. Rising stars that use RL to power their products Based on public information gathered from Crunchbase, Pitchbook, and other open sources, we have compiled a list of venture-backed startups that leverage RL to transform their respective industries with ultimately innovative products. Check out the innovative companies that constitute today's Innovation Landscape in AI in Reinforcement Learning in early 2025.

However, further advancements in RL for energy management face limitations due to a lack of high-quality simulations that accurately reflect real-world scenarios constrains the ability to test and refine RL models comprehensively. Agriculture In Agriculture , RL is optimizing resource use, improving crop yields, and automating tasks. Research suggests RL can help manage water and fertilizer use more efficiently, detect pests and diseases using drones, and optimize planting patterns to enhance productivity. For example, RL-powered drones have been trained to adjust their velocity and height to apply precise amounts of pesticides. There is also exploration of RL-driven robots capable of harvesting crops like apples or pruning grapevines, although these technologies remain largely experimental with limited commercial use. Reinforcement learning-based Digital Twin applications for each category A typical RL workflow in Agriculture involves collecting data, creating a digital twin, training RL models in simulated environments, and deploying them in the real world. However, the absence of mature digital twin systems specific to agriculture is a major challenge. Current efforts are focused on building these simulations to enable RL applications, such as greenhouse energy management. Despite the potential, decision-making systems for plant care are still in the research phase due to limited data and the high cost of errors. While RL shows significant promise in advancing agricultural efficiency and sustainability, practical implementation remains constrained by technological and data limitations. Greeneye Technology , for example, utilizes AI and deep learning to revolutionize agricultural pest control by enabling precise, selective spraying of herbicides. Their proprietary Selective Spraying (SSP) system integrates seamlessly with existing agricultural sprayers, allowing real-time identification and targeted application to weeds, which can reduce herbicide usage by up to 90%. This approach enhances crop management efficiency, reduces environmental impact, and increases profitability for farmers. Taranis employs advanced AI and machine learning techniques to provide high-resolution, leaf-level imagery and actionable insights for crop management. Their platform captures detailed images of crops, enabling the detection of issues such as diseases, pests, and nutrient deficiencies. While Taranis utilizes sophisticated AI and machine learning algorithms, there is no explicit information indicating the use of reinforcement learning in their agricultural solutions. Manufacturing Additionally, RL is making strides in Manufacturing, i.e. in automated design and experimentation. Quilter employs RL for automating printed circuit board (PCB) designs, streamlining production in electronics manufacturing. In quantum physics, companies like Qruise integrate RL to create digital twins that assist researchers in experiments, helping uncover the parameters of quantum devices. These advancements highlight RL's versatility, from logistics to complex scientific research, underscoring its transformative potential across industries. Quilter uses reinforcement learning informed by physics simulations to create a fully automated, superhuman circuit board designer Biotech In Biotech , RL has the potential to address critical challenges, such as workforce shortages in healthcare and the unpredictability of biotech research. Two primary use cases have emerged: dynamic treatment regimes and drug discovery assistance. While the first application, dynamic treatment regimes, is still poorly defined and underexplored among startups, existing research suggests RL could help optimize personalized treatment plans over time (e.g., through mathematical methods as discussed in referenced papers). However, the complexity of medical decision-making and limited understanding of the field poses challenges to broader adoption. The second use case, drug discovery assistance, has gained more traction, with companies like Biomonadic , Ordaos , and Isomorphic Labs leading the way. These firms focus on software that accelerates and improves drug research processes. For example, Biomonadic and Ordaos specialize in optimizing research related to mini-proteins and plasmids, enhancing both speed and efficiency. Isomorphic Labs, supported by Alphabet and employing a sizable team of 164 professionals, is less explicit about its specific contributions but shows promise in pushing innovation forward. RL in biotech is helping to enhance research reliability, streamline processes, and potentially revolutionize drug discovery. Fintech In Fintech, RL is primarily applied to stock market prediction and high-frequency trading (HFT), although its efficacy and limitations spark skepticism. Most current RL-based solutions focus on short-term trading optimizations rather than long-term value investing. Notable examples include AI Capital Management , a hedge fund leveraging RL for HFT, and Equilibre Technologies , which combines RL with game theory for algorithmic trading. Equilibre's team, consisting of former Google DeepMind professionals, recently raised $7 million in funding, signaling credibility and potential for future innovation despite limited public details about their work. Another interesting application of RL in fintech involves optimizing venture capital investments. Recent research introduced an RL agent designed to predict investment amounts in startups based on specific factors. While the model outperforms existing alternatives, the dataset's quality and evaluation metrics remain limitations. Researchers acknowledge that financial performance data of portfolio companies is absent, hindering predictive accuracy. Plans for future work include integrating richer datasets and refining evaluation metrics to better assess fund allocation. This underscores RL's potential in fintech and also highlights the need for robust data and methodological improvements for effective deployment. Alpha VC RL-based Model Framework Game Development RL's role in Gaming is as a training ground for models and as a tool for game development. RL has powered breakthroughs in complex games, such as AlphaGo, OpenAI Five (DOTA2), and AlphaStar (StarCraft II), showcasing its ability to handle intricate strategies and dynamics. In game development, RL is used to create adaptive non-player characters (NPCs) and dynamic environments, with companies like rct AI leading in this space. Additionally, RL supports innovations in animation generation, such as Latent Technology's pre-seed efforts, and emerging areas like text-to-3D model creation, as seen with Irreverent Labs . Education RL is being explored in Education for applications like personalizing curricula, providing adaptive hints and quizzes, and optimizing A/B testing in educational platforms. RL is also used to model human students and generate educational content. However, these efforts face significant challenges, including unreliable and limited datasets, as well as uncertainties about the appropriate level of personalization for each student. There are also concerns about bias in the design of RL agents and the potential unintended consequences of their recommendations. While the technology remains in its infancy with no major startups yet, it holds promise for creating highly adaptive and tailored educational experiences in the future. Healthcare RL in healthcare enables the development of dynamic treatment regimes (DTRs) for chronic conditions, allowing providers to deliver tailored, adaptive interventions that improve patient outcomes. RL also enhances operational efficiency, optimizing resource allocation, scheduling, and workflow in hospitals while reducing costs. In drug discovery, RL accelerates the identification of effective compounds and predicts drug responses, saving time and resources. RL excels in handling uncertainty and complexity, making it invaluable for predicting disease progression and selecting optimal treatments in critical care. By learning from data and outcomes, RL systems refine their strategies to enhance accuracy and reliability, supporting decision-making where traditional methods fall short. Ordaōs utilizes reinforcement learning within its proprietary Design Engine to create de novo mini-proteins, known as miniPRO™, for therapeutic applications. This approach enables the rapid and efficient design of bespoke proteins that are more configurable, stable, and easier to manufacture than traditional antibodies, thereby accelerating the development of safer and more effective treatments. Ordaos miniPRO™ UnityAI employs reinforcement learning (RL) to enhance hospital operations by optimizing patient flow and resource allocation. Their AI-driven platform analyzes real-time data to recommend actions that improve efficiency and patient care. Despite its potential, RL faces challenges like data scarcity, as ethical concerns and privacy regulations limit access to real patient data, requiring simulated environments or historical datasets. Additionally, human physiology's complexity leads to partial observability, complicating decision-making. Effective application of RL depends on improving data availability, creating accurate simulations, and designing reward structures that balance short- and long-term health outcomes. Marketing In Marketing , RL can enhance strategies by enabling dynamic decision-making that adapts to consumer interactions in real-time. RL algorithms can personalize content delivery by analyzing individual customer behaviors and preferences, ensuring that marketing messages align closely with consumer interests.

Remaining Challenges Despite its huge potential, Reinforcement Learning is still nascent in its progress and potential. Below, we summarize some of the challenges that hinder RL from deeper penetration and impact: Data Scarcity and Quality: RL requires substantial amounts of high-quality data for effective training. In many fields, acquiring real-world data is still challenging due to ethical concerns, privacy regulations, skills, or cost. High Computational Costs: RL algorithms are computationally intensive, especially when simulating complex environments or processing high-dimensional data. Meta, for example, owns over 350,000 NVIDIA H100 GPUs for its computing power while most businesses might struggle to obtain a few. Reward Design Complexity: Designing appropriate reward structures that guide the agent effectively is difficult, particularly when balancing short-term and long-term goals. Part of the answer could be in leveraging hierarchical RL and multi-objective optimization to design reward mechanisms that align with complex, real-world objectives. Generalization Issues: RL models often struggle to generalize well to unseen environments or variations in real-world applications. Lack of Explainability: RL models can function as \"black boxes,\" making it hard to explain their decisions, a significant concern in fields like healthcare and autonomous systems. This especially could be an issue in sensitive sectors like healthcare or defense. Developing methods to make RL algorithms interpretable, such as visualizing decision processes or integrating explainable AI (XAI) techniques could be part of the solution. Safety and Ethical Concerns: In critical applications like healthcare or autonomous driving, ensuring safety while the agent explores new strategies is a significant challenge. Implementing robust policies for ethical use, and addressing privacy, fairness, and safety concerns in sensitive applications can help alleviate some of these concerns.

As the founder of Graphite Note, I’ve seen firsthand how these developments have accelerated the adoption of no-code solutions in predictive analytics, revolutionizing the way organizations handle data. In this post, we’ll explore ten key directions shaping the future of machine learning. By the end, you’ll walk away with a deeper understanding of how these trends can drive innovation, sharpen decision-making processes, and open doors to new opportunities in your organization. Democratization of ML Through No-Code Platforms Machine learning is no longer the sole territory of PhDs and data scientists. The rise of no-code platforms is allowing business professionals, marketers, and even educators to unlock the power of ML without extensive programming skills. These platforms leverage intuitive interfaces, automated workflows, and prebuilt templates to make predictive analytics widely accessible. According to a Gartner report, no-code/low-code solutions could account for 70% of new applications developed by 2025, underscoring the magnitude of this shift. Key benefits of no-code ML tools include: Faster time to market, as development cycles are drastically reduced Reduced reliance on niche experts, lowering operational costs Greater flexibility for domain experts to create tailored models Graphite Note’s Pre-Built No-Code Machine Learning Models | Predictive Analytics Use Cases Real-Time Data Processing and Edge Computing As connected devices multiply, real-time data processing becomes more critical. Traditional cloud-based ML solutions can struggle with latency, leading to delays when milliseconds matter. Edge computing solves this by processing data closer to the source—on local hardware or on the device itself—to minimize round trips to a remote server. Why this matters : Healthcare devices can perform diagnostic scans on the spot Autonomous vehicles can make split-second decisions Retailers can deliver on-the-fly personalized recommendations Look for 2025 to bring a surge in edge computing advancements, complementing machine learning trends that focus on immediate data processing and real-time analytics. Ethical and Responsible AI With machine learning’s growing influence comes a heightened need for transparency, fairness, and accountability in predictive models. Inaccurate algorithms can inadvertently harm marginalized communities or reinforce biases in hiring decisions. Policymakers and industry leaders alike are calling for clear guidelines and regulations. Steps toward responsible AI : Implement rigorous bias detection protocols Use diverse training datasets to reduce skewed results Enhance model interpretability, so stakeholders understand the “why” behind predictions Expect more robust frameworks and best practices to emerge around ethical AI development, such as explainable models that reveal how input data generates specific outcomes. Advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) Natural language processing has made leaps in recent years, but 2025 will usher in even more impressive language models. These advanced algorithms can interpret context, tone, and nuances in text, making them invaluable for customer service, social media insights, and content generation. Key NLP innovations to watch : Sentiment analysis that captures emotional subtleties Multilingual support with near-instant translation Context-aware chatbots for personalized user experiences Organizations that integrate NLP into their workflows can transform user interactions and gather richer insights from unstructured text data. Automated Feature Engineering Feature engineering is at the heart of building robust machine learning models. Yet, it often demands significant domain expertise and time-consuming trial and error. By 2025, we can expect automated feature engineering to take center stage among machine learning trends, making it simpler for teams to identify optimal predictors with minimal human intervention. Time savings : Automated algorithms can systematically generate, select, and transform variables faster than manual processes. Consistency : Data scientists and no-code users can rely on reproducible techniques, reducing model bias and errors. Scalability : As organizations accumulate more data, automated feature engineering tools help maintain model accuracy without overwhelming ML teams. In combination with no-code ML platforms like Graphite Note, automated feature engineering removes guesswork and streamlines predictive analytics for users of varied backgrounds. Start Your Graphite Note Free Trial With Data Scientist Support Federated Learning Gains Momentum As data privacy regulations get stricter, federated learning stands out as a method for training models without centralizing raw data. Instead of sending datasets to a single server, the model travels to different nodes—like smartphones or local servers—and learns from distributed data. Why this approach is poised for growth: Privacy preservation : Sensitive information never leaves the user’s device, reducing compliance risks. Reduced bandwidth : Uploading massive datasets to the cloud becomes unnecessary, lowering operational costs. Collaborative potential : Multiple organizations can pool insights without sharing proprietary data. Federated learning dovetails with other machine learning trends—like edge computing—by running computations closer to data sources, ensuring rapid, secure results. Industry-Specific Solutions One-size-fits-all approaches to machine learning are losing ground to highly specialized solutions. From healthcare diagnostics to financial fraud detection, verticalized tools focus on niche data types, terminologies, and workflows. These targeted platforms empower users to produce higher-quality outcomes without wrestling with generic algorithms. Examples of specialized solutions : Healthcare : Models trained on medical images for faster diagnoses Retail : Sales forecasting systems that optimize supply chain decisions Manufacturing : Predictive maintenance to prevent costly equipment failures By honing in on domain-specific complexities, these solutions maximize accuracy and relevance. Reinforcement Learning for Strategic Decision-Making Reinforcement learning (RL) has matured, shifting from game-based achievements (like beating humans at Go) to real-world applications in robotics and resource allocation. In 2025, RL is expected to tackle increasingly sophisticated challenges, from optimizing warehouse operations to managing energy distribution grids. Core RL benefits : Decision-making that continuously adapts based on new information Ability to learn from failures in simulated environments before deployment Empowerment for systems to respond dynamically to changes in conditions Organizations adopting RL can build automated systems that refine their strategies over time, driving better productivity and lower costs. MLOps and Continuous Monitoring Just as DevOps transformed software development, MLOps (Machine Learning Operations) is changing the way ML models move from inception to production. By incorporating best practices around version control, monitoring, and continuous integration, MLOps ensures that models remain accurate and up to date. Essential MLOps components : Model versioning : Tracking every iteration of a model’s code and dataset Automated retraining : Regularly updating models as new data appears Performance dashboards : Monitoring predictions in real time to catch anomalies According to a recent McKinsey & Company article, disciplined MLOps practices can drastically cut the time it takes to deploy updates while minimizing failures. Hybrid AI Approaches and AI Agents Finally, hybrid AI merges different techniques—like combining rule-based systems with neural networks—to overcome the weaknesses of any single methodology. By fusing symbolic reasoning with machine learning, for example, hybrid models can interpret data more intuitively, making them suitable for complex sectors like law, finance, and scientific research. Hybrid AI in action : Automated contract review : Blending semantic understanding of legal clauses with predictive analytics Financial risk assessment : Integrating conventional scoring rules with deep learning methods Scientific breakthroughs : Harnessing symbolic logic to interpret novel data in physics or biology These blended approaches round out our list of top machine learning trends for 2025, highlighting the creative solutions that emerge when AI disciplines intersect. Final Thoughts on the Future of Machine Learning The potential for machine learning has never been more apparent. Innovations in no-code ML, real-time data processing, automated feature engineering, and responsible AI are driving this discipline forward at breakneck speed. As a founder at Graphite Note, I’ve witnessed an increasing demand for user-friendly platforms that bring predictive analytics to everyone, not just those with advanced technical skills. From developing ethical guidelines to embracing federated learning, these machine learning trends underscore an industry-wide focus on scalability, transparency, and collaboration.

    "content": "The State of Reinforcement Learning for LLM Reasoning Subscribe Sign in The State of Reinforcement Learning for LLM Reasoning Understanding GRPO and New Insights from Reasoning Model Papers Sebastian Raschka, PhD Apr 19, 2025 444 31 40 Share A lot has happened this month, especially with the releases of new flagship models like GPT-4.5 and Llama 4. But you might have noticed that reactions to these releases were relatively muted. Why? One reason could be that GPT-4.5 and Llama 4 remain conventional models, which means they were trained without explicit reinforcement learning for reasoning. Meanwhile, competitors such as xAI and Anthropic have added more reasoning capabilities and features into their models. For instance, both the xAI Grok and Anthropic Claude interfaces now include a \"thinking\" (or \"extended thinking\") button for certain models that explicitly toggles reasoning capabilities. In any case, the muted response to GPT-4.5 and Llama 4 (non-reasoning) models suggests we are approaching the limits of what scaling model size and data alone can achieve. However, OpenAI's recent release of the o3 reasoning model demonstrates there is still considerable room for improvement when investing compute strategically, specifically via reinforcement learning methods tailored for reasoning tasks. (According to OpenAI staff during the recent livestream, o3 used 10× more training compute compared to o1.) Source: OpenAI livestream (https://openai.com/live/) on April 16, 2025 While reasoning alone isn't a silver bullet, it reliably improves model accuracy and problem-solving capabilities on challenging tasks (so far). And I expect reasoning-focused post-training to become standard practice in future LLM pipelines. So, in this article, let's explore the latest developments in reasoning via reinforcement learning. This article focuses on reinforcement learning training methods used to develop and improve reasoning models Because it is a relatively long article, I am providing a Table of Contents overview below. To navigate the table of contents, please use the slider on the left-hand side in the web view. Understanding reasoning models RLHF basics: where it all started A brief introduction to PPO: RL's workhorse algorithm RL algorithms: from PPO to GRPO RL reward modeling: from RLHF to RLVR How the DeepSeek-R1 reasoning models were trained Lessons from recent RL papers on training reasoning models Noteworthy research papers on training reasoning models Tip: If you are already familiar with reasoning basics, RL, PPO, and GRPO, please feel free to directly jump ahead to the “Lessons from recent RL papers on training reasoning models” section, which contains summaries of interesting insights from recent reasoning research papers. Understanding reasoning models The big elephant in the room is, of course, the definition of reasoning. In short, reasoning is about inference and training techniques that make LLMs better at handling complex tasks. To provide a bit more detail on how this is achieved (so far), I'd like to define reasoning as follows: Reasoning, in the context of LLMs, refers to the model's ability to produce intermediate steps before providing a final answer. This is a process that is often described as chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning. In CoT reasoning, the LLM explicitly generates a structured sequence of statements or computations that illustrate how it arrives at its conclusion. And below is a figure along with the definition. A simplified illustration of how an LLM might tackle a multi-step reasoning task. Rather than just recalling a fact, the model needs to combine several intermediate reasoning steps to arrive at the correct conclusion. The intermediate reasoning steps may or may not be shown to the user, depending on the implementation. If you are new to reasoning models and would like a more comprehensive introduction, I recommend my previous articles: First Look at Reasoning From Scratch: Chapter 1 Sebastian Raschka, PhD · Mar 29 Read full story Understanding Reasoning LLMs Sebastian Raschka, PhD · Feb 5 Read full story Now, as hinted at the beginning of this section, the reasoning abilities of LLMs can be improved in two ways, as nicely illustrated in a figure from an OpenAI blog post: Accuracy improvements can be achieved through increased training or test-time compute, where test-time compute is synonymous with inference-time compute and inference-time scaling. Source: Annotated figure from https://openai.com/index/learning-to-reason-with-llms/ In my previous article: The State of LLM Reasoning Model Inference Sebastian Raschka, PhD · Mar 8 Read full story I solely focused on the test-time compute methods. In this article, I finally want to take a closer look at the training methods. RLHF basics: where it all started The reinforcement learning (RL) training methods used to build and improve reasoning models are more or less related to the reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF) methodology that is used to develop and align conventional LLMs. So, I want to start with a small recap of how RLHF works before discussing reasoning-specific modification based on RL-based training. Conventional LLMs typically undergo a 3-step training procedure: Pre-training Supervised fine-tuning Alignment (typically via RLHF) The \"original\" LLM alignment method is RLHF, which is part of the standard repertoire when developing LLMs following the InstructGPT paper, which described the recipe that was used to develop the first ChatGPT model. The original goal of RLHF is to align LLMs with human preferences. For instance, suppose you use an LLM multiple times where the LLM generates multiple answers for a given prompt. RLHF guides the LLM towards generating more of the style of answer that you prefer. (Often, RLHF is also used to safety-tune LLMs: to avoid sharing sensitive information, using swear words, and so on.) If you are new to RLHF, here is an excerpt from a talk I gave a few years ago that explains RLHF in less than 5 minutes: Alternatively, the paragraphs below describe RLHF in text form. The RLHF pipeline takes a pre-trained model and fine-tunes it in a supervised fashion. This fine-tuning is not the RL part yet but is mainly a prerequisite. Then, RLHF further aligns the LLM using an algorithm called proximal policy optimization (PPO). (Note that there are other algorithms that can be used instead of PPO; I was specifically saying PPO because that's what was originally used in RLHF and is still the most popular one today.) For simplicity, we will look at the RLHF pipeline in three separate steps: RLHF Step 1 (prerequisite): Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) of the pre-trained model RLHF Step 2: Creating a reward model RLHF Step 3: Fine-tuning via proximal policy optimization (PPO) RLHF Step 1, shown below, is a supervised fine-tuning step to create the base model for further RLHF fine-tuning. Annotated figure from InstructGPT paper, https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.02155 In RLHF step 1, we create or sample prompts (from a database, for example) and ask humans to write good-quality responses. We then use this dataset to fine-tune the pre-trained base model in a supervised fashion. As mentioned before, this is not technically part of RL training but merely a prerequisite. In RLHF Step 2, we then use this model from supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to create a reward model, as shown below. Annotated figure from InstructGPT paper, https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.02155 As depicted in the figure above, for each prompt, we generate four responses from the fine-tuned LLM created in the prior step. Human annotators then rank these responses based on their preferences. Although this ranking process is time-consuming, it might be somewhat less labor-intensive than creating the dataset for supervised fine-tuning. This is because ranking responses is likely simpler than writing them. Upon compiling a dataset with these rankings, we can design a reward model that outputs a reward score for the optimization subsequent stage in RLHF Step 3. The idea here is that the reward model replaces and automates the labor-intensive human ranking to make the training feasible on large datasets. This reward model (RM) generally originates from the LLM created in the prior supervised fine-tuning (SFT) step. To turn the model from RLHF Step 1 into a reward model, its output layer (the next-token classification layer) is substituted with a regression layer, which features a single output node. The third step in the RLHF pipeline is to use the reward model (RM) to fine-tune the previous model from supervised fine-tuning (SFT), which is illustrated in the figure below. Annotated figure from InstructGPT paper, https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.02155 In RLHF Step 3, the final stage, we are now updating the SFT model using proximal policy optimization (PPO) based on the reward scores from the reward model we created in RLHF Step 2. Ahead of AI is a reader-supported publication. To receive new posts and support my work, consider becoming a free or paid subscriber. Subscribe A brief introduction to PPO: RL's workhorse algorithm As mentioned earlier, the original RLHF method uses a reinforcement learning algorithm called proximal policy optimization (PPO). PPO was developed to improve the stability and efficiency of training a policy. (In reinforcement learning, “policy” just means the model we want to train; in this case, policy = LLM.) One of the key ideas behind PPO is that it limits how much the policy is allowed to change during each update step. This is done using a clipped loss function, which helps prevent the model from making overly large updates that could destabilize training. On top of that, PPO also includes a KL divergence penalty in the loss. This term compares the current policy (the model being trained) to the original SFT model. This encourages the updates to stay reasonably close. The idea is to preference-tune the model, not to completely re-train, after all. This is where the “proximal” in proximal policy optimization comes from: the algorithm tries to keep the updates close to the existing model while still allowing for improvement. And to encourage a bit of exploration, PPO also adds an entropy bonus, which this encourages the model to vary the outputs during training. In the following paragraphs, I want to introduce some more terminology to illustrate PPO on a relatively high level. Still, there's a lot of jargon involved, so I tried to summarize the key terminology in the figure below before we continue. Illustration of the key terms in RLHF. For instance, several models are involved in PPO, where PPO is an algorithm used in RLHF (and RLHF is one of the most popular LLM alignment methods). Below, I aim to illustrate the key steps in PPO via pseudo-code. In addition, to make it more intuitive, I will also use an analogy: Imagine you are a chef running a small food delivery service. And you are constantly trying out new recipe variations to improve customer satisfaction. Your overall goal is to tweak your recipe (policy) based on customer feedback (reward). 1. Compute the ratio of the next-token probabilities from the new vs the old policy: ratio = new_policy_prob / old_policy_prob In short, this checks how different our new recipe is from the old one. Side note: Regarding \"new_policy_prob\", we are not using the final updated policy yet. We are using the current version of the policy (i.e., the model we are in the middle of training). However, it's a convention to call it \"new\". So, even though you're still experimenting, we call your current draft the \"new policy\" as per convention. 2. Multiply that ratio by how good the action was (called the advantage): raw_score = ratio * advantage Here, for simplicity, we may assume the advantage is computed based on the reward signal: advantage = actual_reward - expected_reward In the chef analogy, we can think of the advantage as how well the new dish performed: advantage = customer_rating - expected_rating For example, if a customer rates the new dish with a 9/10, and the customers normally give us a 7/10, that's a +2 advantage. Note that this is a simplification. In reality, this involves generalized advantage estimation (GAE), which I am omitting here so as not to bloat the article further. However, one important detail to mention is that the expected reward is computed by a so-called \"critic\" (sometimes also called \"value model\"), and a reward model computes the actual reward. I.e., the advantage computation involves 2 other models, typically the same size as the original model we are fine-tuning. In the analogy, we can think of this critic or value model as a friend we ask to try our new dish before serving it to the customers. We also ask our friend to estimate how a customer would rank it (that's the expected reward). The reward model is the actual customer then who gives the feedback (i.e., the actual reward). 3. Compute a clipped score: If the new policy changes too much (e.g., ratio > 1.2 or < 0.8), we clip the ratio, as follows: clipped_ratio = clamp(ratio, 0.8, 1.2)\nclipped_score = clipped_ratio * advantage In the analogy, imagine that the new recipe got an exceptionally great (or bad) review. We might be tempted to overhaul the entire menu now. But that's risky. So, instead, we clip how much our recipe can change for now. (For instance, maybe we made the dish much spicier, and that one customer happened to love spicy food, but that doesn't mean everyone else will.) 4. Then we use the smaller of the raw score and clipped scor e: if advantage >= 0:\n    final_score = min(raw_score, clipped_score)\nelse:\n    final_score = max(raw_score, clipped_score) Again, this is related to being a bit cautious. For instance, if the advantage is positive (the new behavior is better), we cap the reward. That's because we don't want to over-trust a good result that might be a coincidence or luck. If the advantage is negative (the new behavior is worse), we limit the penalty. The idea here is similar. Namely, we don't want to overreact to one bad result unless we are really sure. In short, we use the smaller of the two scores if the advantage is positive (to avoid over-rewarding), and the larger when the advantage is negative (to avoid over-penalizing). In the analogy, this ensures that if a recipe is doing better than expected, we don't over-reward it unless we are confident. And if it's underperforming, we don't over-penalize it unless it's consistently bad. 5. Calculating the loss: This final score is what we maximize during training (using gradient descent after flipping the sign of the score to minimize). In addition, we also add a KL penalty term, where β is a hyperparameter for the penalty strength: loss = -final_score + β * KL(new_policy || reference_policy) In the analogy, we add the penalty to ensure new recipes are not too different from our original style. This prevents you from \"reinventing the kitchen\" every week. For example, we don't want to turn an Italian restaurant into a BBQ place all of a sudden. This was a lot of information, so I summarized it with a concrete, numeric example in an LLM context via the figure below. But please feel free to skip it if it's too complicated; you should be able to follow the rest of the article just fine. I admit that I may have gone overboard with the PPO walkthrough. But once I had written it, it was hard to delete it. I hope some of you will find it useful! That being said, the main takeaways that will be relevant in the next section are that there are multiple models involved in PPO: 1. The policy, which is the LLM that has been trained with SFT and that we want to further align). 2. The reward model, which is a model that has been trained to predict the reward (see RLHF step 2). 3. The critic, which is a trainable model that estimates the reward. 4. A reference model (original policy) that we use to make sure that the policy doesn't deviate too much. By the way, you might wonder why we need both a reward model and a critic model. The reward model is usually trained before training the policy with PPO. It's to automate the preference labeling by human judges, and it gives the score for the complete responses generated by the policy LLM. The critic, in contrast, judges partial responses. We use it to create the final response. While the reward model typically remains frozen, the critic model is updated during training to estimate the reward created by the reward model better. More details about PPO are out of the scope of this article, but interested readers can find the mathematical details in these four papers that predate the InstructGPT paper: (1) Asynchronous Methods for Deep Reinforcement Learning (2016) by Mnih, Badia, Mirza, Graves, Lillicrap, Harley, Silver, and Kavukcuoglu introduces policy gradient methods as an alternative to Q-learning in deep learning-based RL. (2) Proximal Policy Optimization Algorithms (2017) by Schulman, Wolski, Dhariwal, Radford, and Klimov presents a modified proximal policy-based reinforcement learning procedure that is more data-efficient and scalable than the vanilla policy optimization algorithm above. (3) Fine-Tuning Language Models from Human Preferences (2020) by Ziegler, Stiennon, Wu, Brown, Radford, Amodei, Christiano, Irving illustrates the concept of PPO and reward learning to pretrained language models including KL regularization to prevent the policy from diverging too far from natural language. (4) Learning to Summarize from Human Feedback (2022) by Stiennon, Ouyang, Wu, Ziegler, Lowe, Voss, Radford, Amodei, Christiano introduces the popular RLHF three-step procedure that was later also used in the InstructGPT paper . RL algorithms: from PPO to GRPO As mentioned before, PPO was the original algorithm used in RLHF. From a technical standpoint, it works perfectly fine in the RL pipeline that's being used to develop reasoning models. However, what DeepSeek-R1 used for their RL pipeline is an algorithm called Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), which was introduced in one of their earlier papers: DeepSeekMath: Pushing the Limits of Mathematical Reasoning in Open Language Models (2024) The DeepSeek team introduced GRPO as a variant of Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) that enhances mathematical reasoning abilities while concurrently optimizing the memory usage of PPO. So, the key motivation here is to improve computational efficiency. The efficiency improvements are achieved by dropping the \"critic\" (value model), i.e., the LLM that computes the value function (i.e., the expected future reward). Instead of relying on this additional model to compute the estimated reward to compute the advantages, GRPO takes a simpler approach: it samples multiple answers from the policy model itself and uses their relative quality to compute the advantages. To illustrate the differences between PPO and GRPO, I borrowed a nice figure from the DeepSeekMath paper: Annotated figure from DeepSeekMath: Pushing the Limits of Mathematical Reasoning in Open Language Models (https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03300) to illustrate the differences between PPO and GRPO.

Subscribe RL reward modeling: from RLHF to RLVR So far, we looked at RLHF as a procedure, and we have introduced two reinforcement learning algorithms commonly used for it: PPO and GRPO. But if RLHF is already a core part of the LLM alignment toolkit, what does any of this have to do with reasoning? The connection between RLHF and reasoning comes from how the DeepSeek team applied a similar RL-based approach (with GRPO) to train the reasoning capabilities of their R1 and R1-Zero models. The difference is that instead of relying on human preferences and training a reward mode l, the DeepSeek-R1 team used verifiable rewards . This approach is called reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR). Again, it's worth emphasizing: In contrast to standard RLHF, RLVR bypasses the need for a reward model. So, rather than learning what counts as a \"good\" answer from human-labeled examples, the model gets direct binary feedback (correct or wrong) from a deterministic tool, such as symbolic verifiers or rule-based tools. Think calculators for math problems or compilers for code generation. Example of reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR). The model is prompted to solve a math problem and produces an answer. Instead of using a learned reward model, a symbolic verifier (e.g., a calculator) checks the output and provides binary feedback based on correctness. One motivation here is to avoid noisy or expensive human or learned rewards by using automatic correctness checks as supervision signals during RL. The other motivation is that by using \"cheap\" tools like calculators, we can replace the expensive reward model training and the reward model itself. Since the reward model is usually the whole pre-trained model (but with a regression head), RLVR is much more efficient. So, in short, DeepSeek-R1 used RLVR with GRPO, which eliminates two expensive models in the training procedure: the reward model and the value model (critic), as illustrated in the figure below. Comparison of reinforcement learning setups in LLM training. Traditional RLHF with PPO uses both a reward model (trained on human preferences) and a critic (value model) to guide learning. GRPO eliminates the critic model. RLVR with GRPO goes a step further by also removing the reward model, relying instead on verifiable rewards from symbolic tools like calculators or compilers. In the next section, I want to briefly go over the DeepSeek-R1 pipeline and discuss the different verifiable rewards that the DeepSeek team used. How the DeepSeek-R1 reasoning models were trained Now that we have clarified what RLHF and RLVR are, as well as PPO and GRPO, let's briefly recap the main insights from the DeepSeek-R1 paper in the context of RL and reasoning. First, there were three types of models: DeepSeek-R1-Zero trained with pure RL DeepSeek-R1 trained with instruction fine-tuning (SFT) and RL DeepSeek-Distill variants created via instruction fine-tuning SFT without RL I created a DeepSeek-R1 pipeline diagram to illustrate how these models relate to each other, as shown below. Training pipeline for the DeepSeek-R1 family DeepSeek-R1-Zero was trained using the verifiable rewards (RLVR) with GRPO, and this turned out to be sufficient for the model to exhibit reasoning abilities via intermediate-step generation. This showed that it's possible to skip the SFT stage. The model improves its reasoning abilities through exploration instead of learning from examples. DeepSeek-R1 is the flagship model, the one with the best performance. The difference compared to DeepSeek-R1-Zero is that they alternated instruction fine-tuning, RLVR, and RLHF. DeepSeek-Distill variants are meant to be small and more easily deployable models; they were generated by instruction fine-tuning Llama 3 and Qwen 2.5 models using instruction data from the DeepSeek-R1 model. This approach didn't use any RL for the reasoning part (however, RLHF was used to create the Llama 3 and Qwen 2.5 base models). For more details on explaining the DeepSeek-R1 pipeline, please see my previous article \"Understanding Reasoning LLMs\": Understanding Reasoning LLMs Sebastian Raschka, PhD · Feb 5 Read full story The main takeaway here is that the DeepSeek team didn't use an LLM-based reward model to train DeepSeek-R1-Zero. Instead, they used rule-based rewards for the reasoning training of DeepSeek-R1-Zero and DeepSeek-R1: We do not apply the outcome or process neural reward model in developing DeepSeek-R1-Zero, because we find that the neural reward model may suffer from reward hacking in the large-scale reinforcement learning process [...] To train DeepSeek-R1-Zero, we adopt a rule-based reward system that mainly consists of two types of rewards: (1) Accuracy rewards: The accuracy reward model evaluates whether the response is correct. For example, in the case of math problems with deterministic results, the model is required to provide the final answer in a specified format (e.g., within a box), enabling reliable rule-based verification of correctness. Similarly, for LeetCode problems, a compiler can be used to generate feedback based on predefined test cases. (2) Format rewards: In addition to the accuracy reward model, we employ a format reward model that enforces the model to put its thinking process between '<think>' and '</think>’ tags. Lessons from recent RL papers on training reasoning models I realize that the introduction (i.e., everything up to this point) turned out to be much longer than I expected. Nonetheless, I think that this lengthy introduction is perhaps necessary to put the following lessons into context. After going through a large number of recent papers on reasoning models last month, I have put together a summary of the most interesting ideas and insights in this section. (References like “[1]” point to the corresponding papers listed at the end of the article.) 1. Reinforcement learning further improves distilled models The original DeepSeek-R1 paper demonstrated clearly that supervised fine-tuning (SFT) followed by reinforcement learning (RL) outperforms RL alone. Given this observation, it's intuitive that additional RL should further improve distilled models (as distilled models essentially represent models trained via SFT using reasoning examples generated by a larger model.) Indeed, the DeepSeek team observed this phenomenon explicitly: Additionally, we found that applying RL to these distilled models yields significant further gains. We believe this warrants further exploration and therefore present only the results of the simple SFT-distilled models here. Several teams independently verified these observations: [8] Using the 1.5B DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen model, researchers demonstrated substantial performance improvements from RL fine-tuning with just 7,000 examples and a modest $42 compute budget. Impressively, this small model surpassed OpenAI’s o1-preview on the AIME24 math benchmark. [15] However, another team cautioned that these gains might not always be statistically significant. This suggests that, although RL can improve smaller distilled models, the benchmark results might sometimes be overstating the improvements. Annotated figure from A Sober Look at Progress in Language Model Reasoning: Pitfalls and Paths to Reproducibility, https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07086 2. The problem of long incorrect answers I previously mentioned that RL with verifiable rewards (RLVR) does not strictly require the GRPO algorithm; DeepSeek's GRPO simply happens to be efficient and to perform well. However, [12] showed that vanilla PPO paired with a basic binary correctness reward was sufficient to scale models in reasoning capability and response length. More interestingly, both PPO and GRPO have a length bias. And several papers explored methods to tackle excessively long incorrect answers: [14] Provided an analysis illustrating how PPO inadvertently favors longer responses due to mathematical biases in loss calculations; GRPO may suffer from the same issue. Annotated figure from Concise Reasoning via Reinforcement Learning, https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05185 As a follow-up to the statement above, [7] [10] specifically identified length and difficulty-level biases in GRPO. The modified variant \"Dr. GRPO\" simplifies advantage calculations by removing length and standard deviation normalization, providing clearer training signals. [1] Explicitly penalized lengthy incorrect answers in GRPO while rewarding concise, correct ones. [3] [6] Didn’t directly control response length in GRPO but found token-level rewards beneficial, allowing models to better focus on critical reasoning steps. [5] Introduced explicit penalties in GRPO for responses exceeding specific lengths, enabling precise length control during inference. 3. Emergent abilities from RL Beyond \"AHA\" moments mentioned in the DeepSeek-R1 paper, RL has been shown to induce valuable self-verification and reflective reasoning capabilities in models [2] [9]. Interestingly, similar to the AHA moment, these capabilities emerged naturally during training without explicit instruction. [1] Showed that extending context lengths (up to 128k tokens) further improves the model's self-reflection and self-correction capabilities. 4. Generalization beyond specific domains Most research efforts so far has focused on reasoning tasks in math or coding contexts. However, [4] demonstrated successful generalization by training models on logic puzzles. And models trained on logic puzzles also achieved strong performance in mathematical reasoning tasks. This is evidence for RL's ability to induce general reasoning behaviors independent of specific domain knowledge. 5. Extensions to broader domains As a follow-up to the section above, another interesting insight [11] is that reasoning capabilities can naturally extend beyond structured domains like math, code, and logic. Models successfully applied reasoning to areas including medicine, chemistry, psychology, economics, and education, leveraging generative soft-scoring methods to effectively handle free-form answers. Notable next steps for reasoning models include: Integrating existing reasoning models (e.g., o1, DeepSeek-R1) with capabilities such as external tool use and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG); the just-released o3 model from Open AI paves the way here Speaking of tool-use and search, [9] showed that giving reasoning models the ability to search induces behaviors such as self-correction and robust generalization across benchmarks, despite minimal training datasets. Based on the hoops DeepSeek-R1 team went through in terms of maintaining the performance on knowledge-based tasks, I believe adding search abilities to reasoning models is almost a no-brainer. 6. Is reasoning solely due to RL? The fundamental claim behind DeepSeek-R1 (and R1-Zero) is that RLVR explicitly induces reasoning capabilities. However, recent findings [10] suggest that reasoning behaviors, including the \"Aha moment,\" might already be present in base models due to pre-training on extensive chain-of-thought data. My recent comparisons between DeepSeek V3 base and R1 reinforce this observation, as the updated base model also demonstrates reasoning-like behaviors. For instance, the comparison between the original V3 and R1 models clearly shows the difference between a non-reasoning and a reasoning model: However, this is no longer true when comparing the updated V3 base model to R1: Additionally, [13] identified that self-reflection and self-correction behaviors emerge progressively throughout pre-training across various domains and model sizes. This further complicates the attribution of reasoning capabilities solely to RL methods. Perhaps the conclusion is that RL definitely turns simple base models into reasoning models. However, it's not the only way to induce or improve reasoning abilities. As the DeepSeek-R1 team showed, distillation also improves reasoning. And since distillation, in this paper, meant instruction fine-tuning on chain-of-thought data, it's likely that pre-training on data that includes chain-of-thought data induces these abilities as well. (As I explained in my book through hands-on code, pre-training and instruction fine-tuning are based on the same next-token prediction task and loss functions, after all.) Noteworthy research papers on training reasoning models After reading through a large number of reasoning papers last month, I tried to summarize the most interesting takeaways in the previous section. However, for those who are curious about the sources with a bit more detail, I also listed 15 relevant papers in this section below as an optional read. (For simplicity, the following summaries are sorted by date.) Please note that this list is also not comprehensive (I capped it at 15), as this article is already more than too long! [1] Scaling Reinforcement Learning (And Context Length) 📄 22 Jan, Kimi k1.5: Scaling Reinforcement Learning with LLMs , https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12599 It's interesting that this paper came out the same day as the DeepSeek-R1 paper! Here, the authors showcase a multi-modal LLM trained with RL. Similar to DeepSeek-R1, they didn't use process reward models (PRMs) but employed verifiable rewards. A PRM is a type of reward model used in RL (especially in LLM training) that evaluates not just the final answer but also the reasoning steps that led to it. Another key idea here is that scaling the context length (up to 128k tokens) helps the model plan, reflect, and self-correct during reasoning. So, in addition to the correctness reward that is similar to DeepSeek-R1 they also have a length reward. Specifically, they promote shorter correct responses, and incorrect long answers get penalized more. And they propose a method called long2short to distill these long-chain-of-thought skills into more efficient short-CoT models. (It does this by distilling shorter correct responses from the long-CoT model using methods like model merging, shortest rejection sampling, DPO, and a 2nd round of RL with stronger length penalties.) Annotated figure from Kimi k1.5: Scaling Reinforcement Learning with LLMs, https://arxiv.org/abs//2501.12599 [2] Competitive Programming with Large Reasoning Models 📄 3 Feb, Competitive Programming with Large Reasoning Models , https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06807 This paper from OpenAI evaluates their o-models (like o1, o1-ioi, and o3) on competitive programming tasks. While it doesn't go into the technical details of how RL was applied, it still offers some interesting takeaways. First, the models were trained using outcome-based RL, rather than process-based reward models. This is similar to approaches like DeepSeek-R1 and Kimi. One of the interesting findings is that o3 can learn its own test-time (i.e., inference-time scaling) strategies. For example, it often writes a simple brute-force version of a problem (something that trades efficiency for correctness) and then uses it to verify the outputs of its more optimized solution. This kind of strategy wasn't hand-coded; the model figured it out on its own. So overall, the paper argues that scaling general-purpose RL allows models to develop their own reasoning and verification methods, without needing any human heuristics or domain-specific inference pipelines. In contrast, other (earlier) models like o1-ioi relied on handcrafted test-time strategies like clustering thousands of samples and reranking them, which required a lot of manual design and tuning. Annotated figure from Competitive Programming with Large Reasoning Models, https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06807 [3] Exploring the Limit of Outcome Reward 📄 10 Feb, Exploring the Limit of Outcome Reward for Learning Mathematical Reasoning , https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06781 This paper explores how far RL with just binary \"correct\" or \"wrong\" feedback (like in DeepSeek-R1) can go for solving math problems. To do this, they start by using Best-of-N sampling to collect positive examples and apply behavior cloning on them, which they show is theoretically enough to optimize the policy. To deal with the challenge of sparse rewards (especially when long chains of thought include partially correct steps) they add a token-level reward model that learns to assign importance weights to different parts of the reasoning. This helps the model focus on the most critical steps when learning and improves the overall performance. Annotated figure from Exploring the Limit of Outcome Reward for Learning Mathematical Reasoning, https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06781 [4] LLM Reasoning with Rule-Based Reinforcement (On Logic Data) 📄 20 Feb, Logic-RL: Unleashing LLM Reasoning with Rule-Based Reinforcement Learning , https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14768 DeepSeek-R1 focused on math and code tasks. This paper trains a 7B model using logic puzzles as the main training data. The researchers adopt a similar rule-based RL setup as DeepSeek-R1 but make several adjustments: 1. They introduce a strict format reward that penalizes shortcuts and ensures the model separates its reasoning from its final answer using <think> and <answer> tags. 2. They also use a system prompt that explicitly tells the model to first think through the problem step-by-step before giving the final answer. Even with only 5K synthetic logic problems, the model develops good reasoning skills that generalize well to harder math benchmarks like AIME and AMC. This is particularly interesting because it shows that logic-based RL training can teach models to reason in ways that transfer beyond the original domain. Annotated figure from Logic-RL: Unleashing LLM Reasoning with Rule-Based Reinforcement Learning, https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14768 [5] Controlling How Long A Reasoning Model Thinks 📄 6 Mar, L1: Controlling How Long A Reasoning Model Thinks With Reinforcement Learning , https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04697 One hallmark of reasoning models is that they tend to generate longer outputs because of chain-of-thought reasoning. But by default, there is no explicit way to control how long the responses are. This paper introduces Length Controlled Policy Optimization (LCPO), a simple reinforcement learning method that helps models to adhere to user-specified length constraints while still optimizing for accuracy. In short, LCPO is similar to GRPO, i.e., \"GRPO + Custom Reward for Length Control\" implemented as reward = reward_correctness - α * |target_length - actual_length| where the target length is provided as part of the user prompt. This LCPO method above encourages the model to adhere to the provided target length exactly. In addition, they also introduce an LCPO-Max variant, which, instead of encouraging the model to match the target length exactly, encourages the model to stay below a maximum token length: reward = reward_correctness * clip(α * (target_length - actual_length) + δ, 0, 1) The authors train a 1.5B model called L1 using LCPO, which can adjust its output length based on the prompt. This lets users trade-off between accuracy and compute, depending on the task. Interestingly, the paper also finds that these long-chain models actually become surprisingly good at short reasoning too, even outperforming much larger models like GPT-4o at the same token lengths. Annotated figure from L1: Controlling How Long A Reasoning Model Thinks With Reinforcement Learning, https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04697 [6] Incentivizing the Search Capability in LLMs 📄 10 Mar, R1-Searcher: Incentivizing the Search Capability in LLMs via Reinforcement Learning , https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05592 Reasoning models like DeepSeek-R1 that have been trained with RL rely on their internal knowledge. The authors here focus on improving these models on knowledge-based tasks that require more time-sensitive or recent information by adding access to external search systems. So, this paper improves these models by teaching them to use external search systems during the reasoning process. Instead of relying on test-time strategies or supervised training, the authors use a two-stage reinforcement learning method that helps the model learn how and when to search on its own. The model first learns the search format, and then learns how to use search results to find correct answers. Annotated figure from R1-Searcher: Incentivizing the Search Capability in LLMs via Reinforcement Learning, https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05592 [7] Open-Source LLM Reinforcement Learning at Scale 📄 ​​18 Mar, DAPO: An Open-Source LLM Reinforcement Learning System at Scale , https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14476 While this paper is mainly about developing a DeepSeek-R1-like training pipeline and open-sourcing it, it also proposes interesting improvements to the GRPO algorithm that was used in DeepSeek-R1 training. 1. Clip-higher: Increases the upper bound of the PPO clipping range to encourage exploration and prevent entropy collapse during training. 2. Dynamic sampling: Improves training efficiency by filtering out prompts where all sampled responses are either always correct or always wrong. 3. Token-level policy gradient loss: moves from sample-level to token-level loss calculation so that longer responses can have more influence on the gradient update.* 4. Overlong reward shaping: Adds a soft penalty for responses that get truncated for being too long, which reduces reward noise and helps stabilize training. * Standard GRPO uses a sample-level loss calculation. This involves first averaging the loss over the tokens for each sample and then averaging the loss over the samples. Since the samples have equal weight, the tokens in samples with longer responses may disproportionally contribute less to the overall loss. At the same time, researchers observed that longer responses often contain gibberish before the final answer, and this gibberish wouldn't be sufficiently penalized in the original GRPO sample-level loss calculation. Annotated figure from DAPO: An Open-Source LLM Reinforcement Learning System at Scale, https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14476 [8] Reinforcement Learning for Reasoning in Small LLMs 📄 20 Mar, Reinforcement Learning for Reasoning in Small LLMs: What Works and What Doesn't , https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16219 The original DeepSeek-R1 paper showed that when developing small(er) reasoning models, distillation gives better results than pure RL. In this paper, researchers follow up on this and investigate ways to improve small, distilled reasoning models further with RL. So, using the 1.5B DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen model, they find that with only 7000 training examples and a $42 compute budget, RL fine-tuning can lead to strong improvements. In this case, the improvements are enough to outperform OpenAI's o1-preview on the AIME24 math benchmark, for example. Furthermore, there were 3 interesting learnings in that paper: 1. Small LLMs can achieve fast reasoning improvements within the first 50–100 training steps using a compact, high-quality dataset. But the performance quickly drops if training continues too long, mainly due to length limits and output instability. 2. Mixing easier and harder problems helps the model produce shorter, more stable responses early in training. However, performance still degrades over time. 3. Using a cosine-shaped reward function helps control output length more effectively and improves training consistency. But this slightly reduces peak performance compared to standard accuracy-based rewards. Annotated figure from Reinforcement Learning for Reasoning in Small LLMs: What Works and What Doesn't, https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16219 [9] Learning to Reason with Search 📄 25 Mar, ReSearch: Learning to Reason with Search for LLMs via Reinforcement Learning , https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19470 The ReSearch framework proposed in this paper extends the RL method from the DeepSeek-R1 paper to include search results as part of the reasoning process. The model learns when and how to search based on its ongoing reasoning chain, and it then uses the retrieved information for the next steps of reasoning. This is all done without supervised data on reasoning steps. The researchers also show that this approach can lead to useful behaviors like self-correction and reflection, and that it generalizes well across multiple benchmarks despite being trained on just one dataset. Annotated figure from ReSearch: Learning to Reason with Search for LLMs via Reinforcement Learning, https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19470 PS: How does this method differ from the R1-Searcher discussed earlier? R1-Searcher uses a two-stage, outcome-based reinforcement learning approach. In the first stage, it teaches the model how to invoke external retrieval; in the second, it learns to use the retrieved information to answer questions. ReSearch, in contrast, integrates search directly into the reasoning process. It trains the model end-to-end using reinforcement learning, without any supervision on reasoning steps. Behaviors such as reflecting on incorrect queries and correcting them emerge naturally during training here. [10] Understanding R1-Zero-Like Training 📄 26 Mar, Understanding R1-Zero-Like Training: A Critical Perspective, https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20783 This paper investigates why DeepSeek-R1-Zero's pure RL approach works to improve reasoning. The authors find that some base models like Qwen2.5 already show strong reasoning and even the \"Aha moment\" without any RL. So the \"Aha moment\" might not be induced by RL, but instead inherited from pre-training. This challenges the idea that RL alone is what creates deep reasoning behaviors. The paper also identifies two biases in GRPO: 1. Response-length bias: GRPO divides the advantage by the length of the response. This makes long incorrect answers get smaller penalties, so the model learns to generate longer bad answers. 2. Difficulty-level bias: GRPO also normalizes by the standard deviation of rewards for each question. Easy or hard questions (with low reward variance) get overweighted. To fix this, the authors introduce Dr. GRPO, which is a modification of standard GRPO. Here, they get rid of the response length normalization in the advantage computation. Also, they get rid of the question-level standard deviation. This will result in more efficient training and fewer unnecessary long answers. Especially if the model is wrong, generating a long answer is no longer encouraged. [11] Expanding RL with Verifiable Rewards Across Diverse Domains 📄 31 Mar, Crossing the Reward Bridge: Expanding RL with Verifiable Rewards Across Diverse Domains , https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23829 DeepSeek-R1 and most other reasoning models that followed focused on reward signals from easily verifiable domains like code and math. This paper explores how to extend these methods to more complex areas like medicine, chemistry, psychology, economics, and education, where answers are usually free-form and harder to verify (beyond a simple correct/incorrect). The authors find that using expert-written reference answers makes evaluation more feasible than expected, even in these broader domains. To provide reward signals, they introduce a generative, soft-scoring method without needing heavy domain-specific annotation.

They use vanilla PPO instead of GRPO (which was used in DeepSeek-R1-Zero) and skip the usual KL regularization commonly included in RLHF pipelines. Interestingly, they find that this simple setup (vanilla PPO and a basic binary reward function based on answer correctness) is sufficient to train models that scale up in both reasoning performance and response length. Using the same Qwen-32B base as DeepSeek-R1-Zero, their model outperforms it on multiple reasoning benchmarks while requiring only 1/10 the training steps.

This paper provides a bit of a plot twist, saying that self-correction already appears earlier during pre-training. Concretely, by introducing deliberately flawed chains-of-thought into tasks, the authors measure whether models can identify and correct these errors. They find that both explicit and implicit forms of reflection emerge steadily throughout pre-training. This happens across many domains and model sizes. Even relatively early checkpoints show signs of self-correction, and the ability becomes stronger as pre-training compute increases.

Now, this new paper shows that this behavior comes from the RL training process, not from an actual need for long answers for better accuracy. The RL loss tends to favor longer responses when the model gets negative rewards, which I think explains the \"aha\" moments and longer chains of thought that arise from pure RL training. I.e., if the model gets a negative reward (i.e., the answer is wrong), the math behind PPO causes the average per-token loss becomes smaller when the response is longer. So, the model is indirectly encouraged to make its responses longer. This is true even if those extra tokens don't actually help solve the problem. What does the response length have to do with the loss? When the reward is negative, longer responses can dilute the penalty per individual token, which results in lower (i.e., better) loss values (even though the model is still getting the answer wrong). So the model \"learns\" that longer responses reduce the punishment, even though they are not helping correctness. However, it's important to emphasize that this analysis was done for PPO: Of note, our current analysis is not applicable to GRPO, and a precise analysis of such methods is left for future work. In addition, the researchers show that a second round of RL (using just a few problems that are sometimes solvable) can shorten responses while preserving or even improving accuracy. This has big implications for deployment efficiency.

For instance, I previously discussed the \"20 Mar, Reinforcement Learning for Reasoning in Small LLMs: What Works and What Doesn't\" paper that found RL is effective for distilled models. And also the DeepSeek-R1 paper mentioned Additionally, we found that applying RL to these distilled models yields significant further gains. We believe this warrants further exploration and therefore present only the results of the simple SFT-distilled models here. So, while earlier papers reported large performance boosts from RL, this work finds that many of those improvements might just be noise. The authors show that results on small benchmarks like AIME24 are highly unstable: just changing a random seed can shift scores by several percentage points. When RL models are evaluated under more controlled and standardized setups, the gains turn out to be much smaller than originally reported, and often not statistically significant. However, some models trained with RL do show modest improvements, but these are usually weaker than what supervised fine-tuning achieves, and they often don't generalize well to new benchmarks. So, while RL might help in some cases to improve smaller distilled models, this paper argues that its benefits have been overstated and better evaluation standards are needed to understand what’s actually working.

Credits : Image: Alex Shipps/MIT CSAIL, using assets from Pexels Previous image Next image Coding with large language models (LLMs) holds huge promise, but it also exposes some long-standing flaws in software: code that’s messy, hard to change safely, and often opaque about what’s really happening under the hood. Researchers at MIT’s Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL) are charting a more “modular” path ahead. Their new approach breaks systems into “concepts,” separate pieces of a system, each designed to do one job well, and “synchronizations,” explicit rules that describe exactly how those pieces fit together. The result is software that’s more modular, transparent, and easier to understand. A small domain-specific language (DSL) makes it possible to express synchronizations simply, in a form that LLMs can reliably generate. In a real-world case study, the team showed how this method can bring together features that would otherwise be scattered across multiple services. The team, including Daniel Jackson, an MIT professor of electrical engineering and computer science (EECS) and CSAIL associate director, and Eagon Meng, an EECS PhD student, CSAIL affiliate, and designer of the new synchronization DSL, explore this approach in their paper “ What You See Is What It Does: A Structural Pattern for Legible Software ,” which they presented at the Splash Conference in Singapore in October. The challenge, they explain, is that in most modern systems, a single feature is never fully self-contained. Adding a “share” button to a social platform like Instagram, for example, doesn’t live in just one service. Its functionality is split across code that handles posting, notification, authenticating users, and more. All these pieces, despite being scattered across the code, must be carefully aligned, and any change risks unintended side effects elsewhere. Jackson calls this “feature fragmentation,” a central obstacle to software reliability. “The way we build software today, the functionality is not localized. You want to understand how ‘sharing’ works, but you have to hunt for it in three or four different places, and when you find it, the connections are buried in low-level code,” says Jackson. Concepts and synchronizations are meant to tackle this problem. A concept bundles up a single, coherent piece of functionality, like sharing, liking, or following, along with its state and the actions it can take. Synchronizations, on the other hand, describe at a higher level how those concepts interact. Rather than writing messy low-level integration code, developers can use a small domain-specific language to spell out these connections directly. In this DSL, the rules are simple and clear: one concept’s action can trigger another, so that a change in one piece of state can be kept in sync with another. “Think of concepts as modules that are completely clean and independent. Synchronizations then act like contracts — they say exactly how concepts are supposed to interact. That’s powerful because it makes the system both easier for humans to understand and easier for tools like LLMs to generate correctly,” says Jackson. “Why can’t we read code like a book? We believe that software should be legible and written in terms of our understanding: our hope is that concepts map to familiar phenomena, and synchronizations represent our intuition about what happens when they come together,” says Meng. The benefits extend beyond clarity. Because synchronizations are explicit and declarative, they can be analyzed, verified, and of course generated by an LLM. This opens the door to safer, more automated software development, where AI assistants can propose new features without introducing hidden side effects. In their case study, the researchers assigned features like liking, commenting, and sharing each to a single concept — like a microservices architecture, but more modular. Without this pattern, these features were spread across many services, making them hard to locate and test. Using the concepts-and-synchronizations approach, each feature became centralized and legible, while the synchronizations spelled out exactly how the concepts interacted. The study also showed how synchronizations can factor out common concerns like error handling, response formatting, or persistent storage. Instead of embedding these details in every service, synchronization can handle them once, ensuring consistency across the system. More advanced directions are also possible. Synchronizations could coordinate distributed systems, keeping replicas on different servers in step, or allow shared databases to interact cleanly. Weakening synchronization semantics could enable eventual consistency while still preserving clarity at the architectural level. Jackson sees potential for a broader cultural shift in software development. One idea is the creation of “concept catalogs,” shared libraries of well-tested, domain-specific concepts. Application development could then become less about stitching code together from scratch and more about selecting the right concepts and writing the synchronizations between them. “Concepts could become a new kind of high-level programming language, with synchronizations as the programs written in that language.” “It’s a way of making the connections in software visible,” says Jackson. “Today, we hide those connections in code. But if you can see them explicitly, you can reason about the software at a much higher level. You still have to deal with the inherent complexity of features interacting. But now it’s out in the open, not scattered and obscured.” “Building software for human use on abstractions from underlying computing machines has burdened the world with software that is all too often costly, frustrating, even dangerous, to understand and use,” says University of Virginia Associate Professor Kevin Sullivan, who wasn’t involved in the research. “The impacts (such as in health care) have been devastating. Meng and Jackson flip the script and insist on building interactive software on abstractions from human understanding, which they call ‘concepts.’ They combine expressive mathematical logic and natural language to specify such purposeful abstractions, providing a basis for verifying their meanings, composing them into systems, and refining them into programs fit for human use. It’s a new and important direction in the theory and practice of software design that bears watching.” \"It’s been clear for many years that we need better ways to describe and specify what we want software to do,” adds Thomas Ball, Lancaster University honorary professor and University of Washington affiliate faculty, who also wasn’t involved in the research. “LLMs’ ability to generate code has only added fuel to the specification fire. Meng and Jackson’s work on concept design provides a promising way to describe what we want from software in a modular manner. Their concepts and specifications are well-suited to be paired with LLMs to achieve the designer's intent.” Looking ahead, the researchers hope their work can influence how both industry and academia think about software architecture in the age of AI. “If software is to become more trustworthy, we need ways of writing it that make its intentions transparent,” says Jackson. “Concepts and synchronizations are one step toward that goal.” This work was partially funded by the Machine Learning Applications (MLA) Initiative of CSAIL Alliances. At the time of funding, the initiative board was British Telecom, Cisco, and Ernst and Young.

As predicted by the Market Research Future report, the large language model (LLM) market in North America alone is expected to reach $105.5 billion by 2030. The exponential growth of AI tools combined with access to massive troves of text data has opened gates for better and more advanced content generation than we had ever hoped. Yet, such rapid expansion also makes it harder than ever to navigate and select the right tools among the diverse LLM models available. The goal of this post is to keep you, the AI enthusiast and professional, up-to-date with current trends and essential innovations in the field. Below, we highlighted the top 9 LLMs that we think are currently making waves in the industry, each with distinct capabilities and specialized strengths, excelling in areas such as natural language processing, code synthesis, few-shot learning, or scalability. While we believe there is no one-size-fits-all LLM for every use case, we hope that this list can help you identify the most current and well-suited LLM model that meets your business’s unique requirements. 1. OpenAI OpenAI Flagship GPT-5 Capabilities. Source: OpenAI Our list kicks off with OpenAI's Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT) models, which have consistently exceeded their previous capabilities with each new release. The company has announced its latest flagship model, GPT-5 , a significant leap forward in intelligence. It's their most advanced system yet, offering state-of-the-art performance across coding, math, and writing, and enhanced multimodal capabilities that include visual perception and health-related tasks. GPT-5 is designed to be a unified, all-in-one model and now includes a dedicated \"reasoning\" model for tackling more complex problems. This model is now the default for new users, replacing older versions. OpenAI has also made a move into the open-source community with its new \"open-weight\" models, GPT-oss -120b and GPT-oss-20b. These are released under the Apache 2.0 license, providing strong real-world performance at a lower cost. Optimized for efficient deployment, they can even run on consumer hardware and are particularly effective for agentic workflows , tool use, and few-shot function calling . With the release of GPT-5, older models like GPT-4o, GPT-4, and GPT-3.5 are being deprecated. While GPT-4o was a notable step toward more natural human-computer interaction with its multimodal capabilities, it is now largely superseded. Similarly, the foundational GPT-4 and GPT-3.5 models are considered less capable than the newer GPT-5, which is less prone to reasoning errors and hallucinations . Users who built workflows around older models like o3 and o1 may experience frustration as OpenAI consolidates its offerings. Despite its advanced conversational and reasoning capabilities, GPT remains a proprietary model. OpenAI keeps the training data and parameters confidential, and full access often requires a commercial license or subscription. We recommend this model for businesses seeking an LLM that excels in multi-step reasoning, conversational dialogue, and real-time interactions, particularly those with a flexible budget. 2. DeepSeek DeepSeek, a Chinese AI company, has continued to push the boundaries of AI innovation with a focus on both specialized and versatile models. As of late 2024 and mid-2025, DeepSeek has been actively releasing and updating its models, including the DeepSeek V3.1 and the DeepSeek-R1 series. The latest model, DeepSeek V3.1, released in August 2025, builds on the V3 architecture with a hybrid system that can switch between a \"thinking\" mode for complex reasoning and a \"non-thinking\" mode for faster, direct responses. This model is also open-source and released under the permissive MIT license , which allows for free commercial use, modification, and redistribution with few restrictions. Many organizations use DeepSeek as the model of choice as an all-in-one tool for tasks such as chat, coding, and logical reasoning. The model uses a Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture with multi-head latent attention, which enables it to efficiently handle long contexts up to 128k tokens. For advanced reasoning, the DeepSeek-R1 series was introduced, which includes models like R1-Zero and R1. The R1 series is specifically designed for high-level problem-solving in areas such as financial analysis, complex mathematics, and automated theorem proving. DeepSeek also released the DeepSeek-Prover-V2 , an open-source model tailored for formal theorem proving in Lean 4. To make these powerful capabilities more accessible, DeepSeek has also developed the DeepSeek-R1-Distill series, which are smaller, more efficient models that have been \"distilled\" from the larger R1 model. These distilled models, based on architectures like Qwen and Llama, are perfect for production environments where computational efficiency is a priority. DeepSeek's strategic developments extend to its hardware strategy, with the company reportedly shifting its focus to Huawei AI chips to reduce its reliance on Nvidia . Moreover, the company is said to be working on a new AI agent model to perform complex, multi-step actions with minimal human input, with a potential release in late 2025. This focus on efficiency, specialization, and strategic partnerships positions DeepSeek as a key innovator in the evolving AI landscape. 3. Qwen Qwen Benchmark. Alibaba has been actively advancing its language model lineup, with the latest major releases centered around the Qwen3 series. These hybrid Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models reportedly meet or beat GPT-4o and DeepSeek-V3 on most public benchmarks while using far less compute. The Qwen3 series introduces models like the Qwen3-235B-A22B and Qwen3-30B-A3B , which utilize MoE architecture to deliver high performance with greater efficiency, activating a smaller number of parameters per generation. The models in the Qwen family, spanning from 4 billion to 235 billion parameters, are open-sourced under the Apache 2.0 license and available through multiple platforms including Alibaba Cloud API, Hugging Face, and ModelScope. The Qwen3 series also includes traditional dense models like the Qwen3-32B and Qwen3-4B, which are highly flexible and can be deployed in various settings. For specialized tasks, there are models like Qwen3-Coder for software engineering, Qwen-VL for vision-language applications, and Qwen-Audio for audio processing. For businesses and developers, the Qwen family has gained significant traction, with adoption by over 90,000 enterprises across consumer electronics, gaming, and other sectors. 4. Grok Grok is the generative AI chatbot from xAI, integrated with the social media platform X to offer real-time information and a witty conversational experience. The Grok family of models is designed as a tiered lineup, with each model optimized for a different purpose. The latest flagship models are Grok 4 and Grok 4 Heavy is xAI's most intelligent models, topping several key benchmarks with enhanced reasoning refined through large-scale reinforcement learning. It includes native tool use and real-time search, making it \"agentic,\" meaning it can handle complex, multi-step tasks and make decisive plans. For developers, Grok Code Fast 1 is a specialized, cost-effective model built for \"agentic coding,\" excelling at automating software development workflows, debugging, and generating code. These recent models build on the foundation laid by their predecessors. Grok 3 introduced advanced reasoning capabilities with a \"Think\" mode for step-by-step problem-solving and a \"DeepSearch\" function for in-depth, real-time research. Grok 2 was the first to introduce multimodality, including image understanding and text-to-image generation. Given this diverse lineup, Grok is recommended for a range of applications. Grok 4 is ideal for heavy research, data analysis, and expert-level problem-solving. Grok Code Fast 1 is the go-to for software development where speed and cost are a priority. For a balance of speed and quality, the Grok 3 models are well-suited for advanced problem-solving, education, and real-time analysis of current events. 5. Llama Meta continues to be a leader in the LLM space with its state-of-the-art Llama models, prioritizing an open-source approach. The latest major release is Llama 4 , which includes natively multimodal models like Llama 4 Scout and Llama 4 Maverick. These models can process text, images, and short videos, and are built on a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture for increased efficiency. Llama 4 Scout is notable for its industry-leading context window of up to 10 million tokens, making it ideal for tasks requiring extensive document analysis. The Llama 3 series, including Llama 3.1 and 3.3, are powerful text-based models optimized for applications in customer service, data analysis, and content creation. Unlike closed-source models such as those from OpenAI and Google, Llama’s open-source nature offers developers greater flexibility and control. This allows for fine-tuning the models to specific needs and deploying them on private infrastructure, appealing to businesses seeking scalability and greater security. In terms of performance, Llama 4 Maverick and Scout have been reported to outperform competitors like GPT-4o and Gemini 2.0 Flash across various benchmarks, especially in coding, reasoning, and multilingual capabilities. The open availability and competitive performance of these models foster a large community of researchers and developers. 6. Claude Claude 4 Series Benchmark. Anthropic’s latest flagship models, the Claude 4 family (Opus 4 and Sonnet 4.5 ), build on the foundation of the Claude 3 series by integrating multiple reasoning approaches. A standout feature is the “extended thinking mode,” which leverages a technique of deliberate reasoning or self-reflection loops. This allows the model to iteratively refine its thought process, evaluate various reasoning paths, and optimize for accuracy before finalizing an output, making it suitable for complex, multi-step problem-solving. Claude models are designed as a versatile family, with each model balancing intelligence, speed, and cost. Claude Opus 4 is the most powerful model, excelling at complex, long-running tasks and agent workflows, with particular strengths in coding and advanced reasoning. Claude Sonnet 4.5 is the newest model, considered the best for real-world agents and coding, and can autonomously sustain complex, multi-step tasks for over 30 hours, while also being an all-around performer optimized for enterprise workloads like data processing. Claude Haiku 3 is the fastest and most compact model, ideal for real-time interactions such as customer support and content moderation. While the older Claude 3 models featured a 200K-token context window, the Claude 4 models also offer an impressive 200K token window (with a beta 1 million token context window on Sonnet 4), allowing them to process lengthy documents. The models are multimodal, capable of processing both text and images, and have introduced new features like \"computer use,\" which allows them to navigate a computer's screen with enhanced proficiency . Overall, the Claude family is a strong competitor to models like Google's Gemini and OpenAI's GPT-4, consistently performing well on benchmarks for coding and reasoning. 7. Mistral Mistral AI, a prominent player in the LLM landscape, offers a diverse portfolio of models for both the open-source community and enterprise clients. A key differentiator is its specialized and flexible model approach, providing options tailored for specific use cases.

Get Started trusted by leaders Whitepaper Introduction If we had to choose one word to describe the rapid evolution of AI today, it would probably be something along the lines of explosive . As predicted by the Market Research Future report, the large language model (LLM) market in North America alone is expected to reach $105.5 billion by 2030. The exponential growth of AI tools combined with access to massive troves of text data has opened gates for better and more advanced content generation than we had ever hoped. Yet, such rapid expansion also makes it harder than ever to navigate and select the right tools among the diverse LLM models available. The goal of this post is to keep you, the AI enthusiast and professional, up-to-date with current trends and essential innovations in the field. Below, we highlighted the top 9 LLMs that we think are currently making waves in the industry, each with distinct capabilities and specialized strengths, excelling in areas such as natural language processing, code synthesis, few-shot learning, or scalability. While we believe there is no one-size-fits-all LLM for every use case, we hope that this list can help you identify the most current and well-suited LLM model that meets your business’s unique requirements. 1. OpenAI OpenAI Flagship GPT-5 Capabilities. Source: OpenAI Our list kicks off with OpenAI's Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT) models, which have consistently exceeded their previous capabilities with each new release. The company has announced its latest flagship model, GPT-5 , a significant leap forward in intelligence. It's their most advanced system yet, offering state-of-the-art performance across coding, math, and writing, and enhanced multimodal capabilities that include visual perception and health-related tasks. GPT-5 is designed to be a unified, all-in-one model and now includes a dedicated \"reasoning\" model for tackling more complex problems. This model is now the default for new users, replacing older versions. OpenAI has also made a move into the open-source community with its new \"open-weight\" models, GPT-oss -120b and GPT-oss-20b. These are released under the Apache 2.0 license, providing strong real-world performance at a lower cost. Optimized for efficient deployment, they can even run on consumer hardware and are particularly effective for agentic workflows , tool use, and few-shot function calling . With the release of GPT-5, older models like GPT-4o, GPT-4, and GPT-3.5 are being deprecated.

As we look to 2025, large language models (LLMs) are at the center of a technological revolution that promises not only to transform industries but also to redefine our daily interactions with machines. With unprecedented advances in efficiency, sustainability, and application-specific customization, LLMs are evolving from experimental prototypes into indispensable tools that power everything from chatbots and content creation to autonomous agents and data analytics. In this post, we explore the key trends that will define LLM development in 2025, highlight eye-opening statistics and expert quotes, and consider both the exciting opportunities and critical challenges that lie ahead. 1. The Evolution of LLMs: From Research Prototypes to Ubiquitous Tools Large language models have come a long way since the early days of statistical language modeling. Today’s LLMs — powered by transformer architectures — have grown in size, capability, and complexity. They are no longer just academic curiosities; they are deployed across industries and are reshaping workflows in finance, healthcare, retail, manufacturing, and more. As noted on Wikipedia, LLMs are “designed for natural language processing tasks such as language generation” and have demonstrated impressive abilities in predicting syntax, semantics, and even generating creative content. Yet with all this power comes a set of challenges — from resource consumption and training costs to ethical issues and potential misuse. In 2025, the focus will be as much on refining and securing these models as it is on scaling them up. 2. Efficiency and Sustainability: The Next Frontier Smaller Models, Bigger Impact One of the most compelling trends is the drive toward creating smaller, more efficient LLMs. Today’s LLMs can consume tremendous amounts of energy and require vast computational resources — a reality that has spurred a push for “Green AI.” For instance, Goldman Sachs has predicted that data center power demand could soar by 160% by 2030, making efficiency not just a cost issue but also an environmental imperative. Innovative startups are already demonstrating that it is possible to build models with comparable performance at a fraction of the cost. DeepSeek — a Chinese AI startup — recently showcased its DeepSeek-R1 model, a 671-billion-parameter reasoning model that achieved performance similar to high-end models from tech giants yet with significantly lower inference costs. According to sellside commentary, DeepSeek’s approach “breaks the AI capex narrative” by reducing training costs from billions to just a few million dollars. Sustainability in AI: Cutting Energy Use The drive toward sustainability in AI development has spurred research into optimizing training techniques, improving hardware efficiency, and even exploring alternative energy sources for data centers. With inference costs dropping by an order of magnitude each year — a trend highlighted by Wired — developers are poised to create LLM-powered apps that are not only powerful but also cost-effective and environmentally friendly. 3. Specialization and Customization: Domain-Specific LLMs Verticalized AI Solutions As industries mature in their adoption of AI, there is a growing demand for LLMs that are tailored to specific applications. Instead of relying solely on general-purpose models like GPT-4, businesses are increasingly turning to domain-specific LLMs. These models can be fine-tuned with proprietary data to improve accuracy, compliance, and efficiency in tasks ranging from financial forecasting and fraud detection to personalized healthcare diagnostics. For example, in finance, specialized LLMs are being used to detect irregular transaction patterns and monitor compliance in real time. A recent survey found that by 2025, it is estimated that 50% of digital work in financial institutions will be automated using such models, leading to faster decision-making and reduced operational costs. Customizable Models for Enhanced Performance Customization is not only about tailoring models to industries but also about improving the end-user experience. Companies are now offering APIs and fine-tuning services that allow organizations to “own” an LLM that speaks their language — both literally and figuratively. For instance, a retail company might fine-tune its LLM to better understand product descriptions and customer reviews, thereby delivering highly personalized shopping recommendations. This trend of customization is paving the way for more human-like interactions and greater trust in AI systems. 4. Multimodal Capabilities: Beyond Text Integration of Text, Image, Audio, and Video LLMs are no longer confined to processing and generating text. The next generation of models will be truly multimodal, capable of integrating text with images, audio, and even video. This evolution is crucial for applications such as virtual assistants, medical diagnostics, and interactive media. Imagine an AI that can not only answer your questions but also analyze visual data from medical scans or generate multimedia content on the fly. Recent advancements suggest that multimodal LLMs will soon enable richer, more complex user experiences, merging the best of natural language processing with computer vision and audio processing. Cross-Language and Cross-Domain Translation The ability to work seamlessly across languages and domains is another hallmark of the upcoming multimodal revolution. In 2025, LLMs will be able to process information in multiple languages, breaking down barriers in global communication. This capability will be particularly transformative for multinational companies and global research collaborations, where real-time, accurate translation is paramount. 5. Responsible and Ethical AI Development Bias Mitigation and Fairness With great power comes great responsibility. LLMs are only as good as the data they are trained on, and that data often contains biases. Experts warn that these models can inadvertently reinforce harmful stereotypes or produce biased outputs. In response, the industry is placing a strong emphasis on bias mitigation and fairness. Tech leaders are exploring advanced techniques such as fairness-aware training, enhanced data curation, and continuous monitoring of deployed models. For instance, initiatives from organizations like OWASP are now providing updated “Top 10 Risks” for LLMs to help developers secure their systems against vulnerabilities and biases. Data Privacy, Security, and Transparency In a world increasingly concerned with privacy, LLMs must operate within strict data protection frameworks. Data privacy and security are not optional extras but critical components of AI development. Companies are now adopting methods such as federated learning and differential privacy to ensure that AI systems can learn from data without compromising user confidentiality. Moreover, transparency in how these models make decisions is vital. Research is underway to develop explainable AI (XAI) techniques that allow users to understand the reasoning behind an LLM’s output — a crucial step in building trust and ensuring regulatory compliance. 6. Autonomous Agents: The New Frontier of Productivity Agents that Act on Your Behalf Perhaps one of the most exciting trends for 2025 is the rise of autonomous agents. These are AI-powered systems that can perform complex tasks — such as making purchases, scheduling meetings, or even handling customer support — without constant human intervention. At the Reuters NEXT conference in New York, business executives forecast that autonomous agents will dominate the AI agenda next year. OpenAI CFO Sarah Friar stated, “I think we are going to see a lot of motion next year around agents, and I think people are going to be surprised at how fast this technology comes at us”. Real-World Productivity Gains The promise of autonomous agents lies in their ability to drive significant productivity gains. Companies like Relevance AI are already using these systems to reimagine back-office functions and front-office customer interactions. By automating routine tasks, businesses can reduce labor costs dramatically. One study reported that by integrating LLM-powered agents, organizations have been able to increase their margins substantially while reducing the time spent on mundane tasks. Furthermore, as these agents become more capable, experts predict that artificial general intelligence (AGI) could be achieved in the coming few years — ushering in an era where machines not only assist but also enhance human decision-making at an unprecedented scale. 7. Advances in Training and Fine-Tuning Techniques Few-Shot and Zero-Shot Learning Training large language models traditionally required vast datasets and significant computational power. However, recent advances in few-shot and zero-shot learning have dramatically reduced these requirements. These techniques allow models to generalize from very few examples, enabling faster deployment and more agile updates. This is particularly important for businesses that need to rapidly adapt to changing market conditions without incurring massive retraining costs. Reinforcement Learning and Reasoning Models A breakthrough in LLM research has been the development of “reasoning models.” OpenAI’s recent o1 model, for instance, demonstrated significant improvements in mathematics, science, and coding tasks by generating detailed, step-by-step solutions before arriving at an answer. This trend is complemented by innovations from companies like DeepSeek, which released its R1 model that leverages reinforcement learning to achieve high performance at a fraction of the cost of its competitors. These models are not only more effective but also more cost-efficient — a win-win for enterprises looking to maximize ROI. 8. Market Impact and Economic Forecasts Explosive Growth and Investment Surge The global market for AI is projected to skyrocket in the coming years. Recent reports indicate that the global LLM market could grow from USD 6.4 billion in 2024 to over USD 36.1 billion by 2030 — a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of more than 33%. North America alone is forecasted to hit astonishing numbers, with some estimates predicting the market could reach over USD 105 billion by 2030. Venture capital investments are also surging. As LLMs continue to demonstrate their transformative potential, investors are increasingly backing startups that focus on developing efficient, scalable, and domain-specific models. The sellside analysis of DeepSeek, for example, has drawn attention to how innovative, cost-effective AI can upend traditional capex models, forcing even tech giants to rethink their strategies. Economic and Societal Benefits Beyond corporate balance sheets, the economic impact of LLMs will be felt across society. Goldman Sachs has suggested that generative AI could boost global GDP by as much as 7% over the next decade. Furthermore, the proliferation of AI-powered applications is expected to create new job categories while simultaneously automating routine tasks — an effect that has been compared to past technological revolutions like the advent of personal computing and mobile internet. 9. Security and Risk Mitigation The OWASP Top 10 for LLM Security As LLMs become more integral to business and society, ensuring their security is paramount. OWASP’s updated Top 10 list for LLMs in 2025 highlights a range of risks — from resource mismanagement (unbounded consumption) to system prompt leakage and excessive agency. These guidelines are critical for developers to understand and mitigate vulnerabilities in AI applications. Mitigating Misinformation and Bias Security concerns are not limited to technical vulnerabilities. Misinformation, political bias, and the potential for harmful outputs are significant challenges that developers and policymakers must address. By incorporating robust safety measures — such as advanced content filtering, bias audits, and explainability protocols — companies can safeguard against these risks while continuing to innovate. A recent study noted that models like ChatGPT occasionally “hallucinate” or generate inaccurate information, underscoring the need for continuous monitoring and human oversight. These challenges have spurred collaborative efforts among researchers, industry leaders, and regulatory bodies to develop best practices for responsible AI deployment. 10. Looking Ahead: Predictions for 2025 and Beyond The Road to AGI One of the most ambitious predictions for the coming years is the eventual achievement of artificial general intelligence (AGI). While current LLMs still face significant limitations — especially in long-term planning and complex reasoning — advances in step-by-step reasoning models and reinforcement learning are gradually closing the gap. OpenAI CFO Sarah Friar recently expressed optimism that AGI could be “in the shorter term,” suggesting that machines capable of outperforming humans in economically valuable tasks might be closer than we think. A New Era of Autonomous Agents By 2025, the rise of autonomous agents is expected to transform the way we interact with technology. These agents will be integrated into daily workflows, handling everything from scheduling and purchasing to customer service and data analysis. As these systems become more sophisticated, they will not only enhance productivity but also pave the way for entirely new business models. With LLMs driving this change, we may soon witness a world where human and machine collaboration is seamless and ubiquitous. Democratization of AI Perhaps the most promising trend is the democratization of AI. With the development of smaller, more efficient models and the proliferation of open-source projects, cutting-edge AI technology will become accessible to a much broader range of users. This democratization is likely to spur innovation across industries and empower smaller companies and individual developers to create AI applications that were once the exclusive domain of tech giants. Conclusion As we stand on the cusp of 2025, the landscape for large language models is one of both excitement and responsibility. On one hand, we are witnessing unprecedented advances in efficiency, specialization, multimodal integration, and autonomous agent capabilities. On the other hand, the challenges of energy consumption, security risks, bias, and ethical considerations remind us that with great power comes great responsibility. The trends discussed — from the rise of sustainable, cost-effective models to the emergence of domain-specific and multimodal AI, and the push toward autonomous agents — are set to redefine how we interact with technology. With significant economic and societal benefits on the horizon, the next few years promise to be transformative. As investments surge and new use cases emerge, the global impact of LLMs will only continue to grow. Whether you are an industry leader, a developer, or simply an AI enthusiast, 2025 will be a pivotal year. Embracing these trends responsibly, while staying vigilant about security and ethical issues, will be key to harnessing the full potential of AI.

But how do they work? What are they capable of? And what should we look out for when using them? Read on and find out in this guide for LLMs in 2024. Jump ahead: Understanding Large Language Models What is a Large Language Model? How Do Large Language Models Work? Key Milestones in Large Language Model Development Capabilities of Large Language Models Challenges and Limitations of LLMs The Future of Language Models: What Comes Next? Understanding Large Language Models Let’s get the basics out of the way. Here we’ll define the large language model (LLM), explain how they work, and provide a timeline of key milestones in LLM development. What is a Large Language Model? A large language model, often abbreviated to LLM, is a type of artificial intelligence model designed to understand natural language as well as generate it at a large scale. When we say human language, we don’t just mean English, Spanish, or Cantonese. Those are certainly part of what LLMs are trained on but human language, in this context, also extends to: Art Dance Morse code Genetic code Hieroglyphics Cryptography Sign language Body language Musical notation Chemical signaling Emojis and symbols Animal communication Haptic communications Traffic signs and signals Mathematical equations Programming languages LLMs are trained on billions of parameters and have the ability to learn from a wide range of data sources. This extensive training enables them to predict and produce text based on the input they receive so that they can engage in conversations, answer queries, or even write code. Some of the leading very large models include giants like GPT, LLaMa, LaMDA, PaLM 2, BERT, and ERNIE. They’re at the heart of various applications, aiding in everything from customer service chatbots to content creation and software development. Some companies even build their own LLMs but that requires significant time, investment, and tech knowledge. It’s much easier to integrate a pre-trained LLM into your own systems. How Do Large Language Models Work? Large Language Models use a blend of neural networks and machine learning (ML). It’s this blend that allows the technology to first process and then generate original text and imagery. Think of neural networks as the LLM’s brain. It’s these networks that learn from vast amounts of data, improving over time as they’re exposed to more. As the model is trained on more data, it learns patterns, structures, and the nuances of language. It’s like teaching it the rules of grammar, the rhythm of poetry, and the jargon of technical manuals all at once. Machine learning models then help the model to predict the next word in a sentence based on the words that come before it. This is done countless times, refining the model’s ability to generate coherent and contextually relevant text. LLMs now also operate on a Transformer Architecture. This architecture allows the model to look at and weigh the importance of different words in a sentence. It’s the same as when we read a sentence and look for context clues to understand its meaning. ⚠️ While LLMs can generate original content, the quality, relevance, and innovativeness of their output can vary and require human oversight and refinement. The originality is also influenced by how the prompts are structured, the model’s training data, and the specific capabilities of the LLM in question. Key Milestones in Large Language Model Development Large language models haven’t always been as useful as they are today. They’ve developed and been iterated upon significantly over time. Let’s look at some of those key moments in LLM history.

Here’s an example to illustrate how LLMs can be used for text generation: Prompt: “Generate a product description for a cutting-edge smartwatch designed for fitness enthusiasts. The description should highlight its advanced health and fitness tracking, personalized coaching, long battery life, durability, connectivity features, and customizable design. Target the description to appeal to both seasoned athletes and beginners interested in tracking their fitness progress.” Language Translation They can translate text between different languages, often with a high degree of accuracy, depending on the languages involved and the model’s training data. Here’s an example to illustrate how LLMs can be used for language translation: Prompt: “Translate the following English text into Spanish: ‘The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.'” Bug Detection and Correction LLMs can help identify bugs in code by analyzing code patterns and suggesting fixes for common errors, potentially integrating with IDEs (Integrated Development Environments) to provide real-time assistance. Here’s an example to illustrate how LLMs can be used for bug detection: Prompt: “The Python function below intends to return the nth Fibonacci number. Please identify and correct any bugs in the function. Python Function: def fibonacci(n): if n <= 1: return n else: return fibonacci(n – 1) + fibonacci(n – 2)” Paraphrasing and Rewriting They can rephrase or rewrite text while maintaining the original meaning, useful for content creation and academic purposes. Here’s an example to illustrate how LLMs can be used for paraphrasing: Prompt: “Rewrite the following sentence in a simpler and more concise way without losing its original meaning: ‘The comprehensive study on climate change incorporates a wide array of data, including historical weather patterns, satellite imagery, and computer model predictions, to provide a holistic view of the impacts of global warming.'” Dialogue Systems LLMs power sophisticated dialogue systems for customer service, interactive storytelling, and educational purposes, providing responses that can adapt to the user’s input. Think of a chatbot on a software product you use where you can ask it questions and it generates insightful, helpful responses. Challenges and Limitations of LLMs Large language models have come a long way since the early days of Eliza. In the last two years alone, we’ve seen LLMs power Generative AI and create high-quality text, music, video, and images. But with any technology, there will always be growing pains. Technical Limitations of Language Models Large Language Models sometimes face technical limitations impacting their accuracy and ability to understand context. Domain Mismatch Models trained on broad datasets may struggle with specific or niche subjects due to a lack of detailed data in those areas. This can lead to inaccuracies or overly generic responses when dealing with specialized knowledge. Word Prediction LLMs often falter with less common words or phrases, impacting their ability to fully understand or accurately generate text involving these terms. This limitation can affect the quality of translation, writing, and technical documentation tasks. Real-time Translation Efficiency While LLMs have made strides in translation accuracy, the computational demands of processing and generating translations in real-time can strain resources , especially for languages with complex grammatical structures or those less represented in training data. Hallucinations and Bias On occasion, LLM technology is too original. So original in fact that it’s making up information. This is a lesson Air Canada learned the hard way when its chatbot told a customer about a refund policy when no such policy exists, which they then had to honor. Finally, LLMs can inadvertently propagate and amplify biases present in their training data, leading to outputs that may be discriminatory or offensive. Scalability and Environmental Impact The scalability of LLMs is tied to the impact it has on the environment. And that impact is turning out to be a big one. Training a system like GPT-3 took 1,287 Megawatt hours (MWh) of energy. To put that into perspective, 1 MWh could power about 330 homes for one hour in the United States. The image below shows the energy consumption of training four different LLMs. Energy consumption doesn’t end at training—operating LLMs also uses a grotesque level of energy. In one report, Alex de Vries , founder of Digiconomist, has calculated that by 2027 the AI sector will consume between 85 to 134 Terawatt hours each year. That’s almost the same as the annual energy demand of the Netherlands. We can’t help but wonder how sustainable that is and what the long-term environmental impact will be on our energy sources. Especially when you consider LLMs are only going to become larger and more complex as we advance their capabilities. And to maintain large language models, we’ll need to update them with new data and parameters as they arise. That will only expend more energy and resources. The Future of Language Models: What Comes Next? Now that we’ve seen drastic and rapid improvement in the capabilities of LLMs through Generative AI, we expect users of AI to be fine-tuning prompts and discovering new use cases and applications. In the workplace especially, the focus will be on productivity hacks. It’s something we experiment with already through our Generative Driven Development™ offering, where our team has increased the productivity of software development by 30-50%. Hilary Ashton, Chief Product Officer at Teradata, shared her predictions for the future of LLMs and AI in AI Magazine : First, I foresee a massive productivity leap forward through GenAI, especially in technology and software. It’s getting more cost-effective to get into GenAI, and there are lots more solutions available that can help improve GenAI solutions. It will be the year when conversations gravitate to GenAI, ethics, and what it means to be human. In some cases, we’ll start to see the workforce shift and be reshaped, with the technology helping to usher in a four-day work week for some full-time employees.” Hilary Ashton And she’s right, especially when it comes to ethical considerations and where we humans add value AI can’t replicate. We’ll also see further democratization of AI with it infiltrating other areas of our life, much the same the computer has done since its invention. What we know for certain is the development of LLMs and Generative AI is only getting started. And we want to be leading conversations on its use, ethics, scalability, and more as it evolves. You can be part of that conversation too: Listen or watch our Talking AI podcast where we interview AI experts and talk or sign up for our newsletter where we share insights and developments on LLMs, AI/ML, and Data governance, curated by our very own CTO, Omar Shanti. Frequently Asked Questions About Large Language Models LLMs 1. What is a Large Language Model (LLM)? A Large Language Model (LLM) is an artificial intelligence model that uses machine learning techniques, particularly deep learning and neural networks, to understand and generate human language. These models are trained on massive data sets and can perform a broad range of tasks like generating text, translating languages, and more. 2. How do Large Language Models work?

They are pre-trained on vast amounts of data and can perform in-context learning, allowing them to generate coherent and contextually relevant responses based on user inputs. 3. What is the significance of transformer models in LLMs? Transformer models are crucial because they enable LLMs to handle long-range dependencies in text through self-attention. This mechanism allows the model to weigh the importance of different words in a sentence, improving the language model’s performance in understanding and generating language. 4. Why are Large Language Models important in AI technologies? Large Language Models are important because they serve as foundation models for various AI technologies like virtual assistants, conversational AI, and search engines. They enhance the ability of machines to understand and generate human language, making interactions with technology more natural. 5. What is fine-tuning in the context of LLMs? Fine-tuning involves taking a pre-trained language model and further training it on a specific task or dataset. This process adjusts the model to perform better on specific tasks like sentiment analysis, handling programming languages, or other specialized applications. 6. How does model size affect the performance of Large Language Models? The model size, often measured by the parameter count, affects an LLM’s ability to capture complex language patterns. Very large models with hundreds of billions of parameters generally perform better but require more computational resources during the training process. 7. Can LLMs generate code in programming languages? Yes, Large Language Models can generate code in various programming languages. They assist developers by providing code snippets, debugging help, and translating code, thanks to their training on diverse datasets that include programming code. 8. What is “in-context learning” in Large Language Models? In-context learning refers to an LLM’s ability to learn and perform specific tasks based solely on the input text provided during inference, without additional fine-tuning. This allows the model to adapt to new tasks or instructions on the fly, enhancing its versatility across a broad range of applications. 9. How do LLMs handle multiple tasks like text generation and sentiment analysis? LLMs are versatile due to their training on diverse data. They can perform multiple tasks like text generation, sentiment analysis, and more by leveraging their learned knowledge. Through fine-tuning, they can be adapted to perform specific tasks more effectively. 10. What are “zero-shot” and “few-shot” learning in Large Language Models? Zero-shot learning allows an LLM to perform a specific task it wasn’t explicitly trained on by leveraging its general language understanding. Few-shot learning involves providing the model with a few examples of the task within the prompt to guide its response.

It feels like every week there's a new model or a mind-bending way to \"talk\" to these things. As someone who's been diving deep into this, I wanted to break down some of the coolest and most important developments in how we prompt AIs and what these new AIs can actually do. Grab your tinfoil hats (or your optimist hats!), because here’s the lowdown: Part 1: Talking to AIs is Getting Seriously Advanced (Way Beyond \"Write Me a Poem\") Remember when just getting an AI to write a coherent sentence was amazing? Well, \"prompt engineering\" – the art of telling AIs what to do – has gone from basic commands to something much more like programming a weird, super-smart alien brain. The OG Tricks Still Work: Don't worry, the basics like Zero-Shot (just ask it directly) and Few-Shot (give it a couple of examples) are still your bread and butter for simple stuff. Chain-of-Thought (CoT), where you ask the AI to \"think step by step,\" is also a cornerstone for getting better reasoning.   But Check Out These New Moves: Mixture of Formats (MOF): You know how AIs can be weirdly picky about how you phrase things? MOF tries to make them tougher by showing them examples in lots of different formats. The idea is to make them less \"brittle\" and more focused on what you mean, not just how you type it.   Multi-Objective Directional Prompting (MODP): This is like prompt engineering with a scorecard. Instead of just winging it, MODP helps you design prompts by tracking multiple goals at once (like accuracy AND safety) and tweaking things based on actual metrics. Super useful for real-world applications where you need reliable results.   Hacks from the AI Trenches: The community is on fire with clever ideas :   Recursive Self-Improvement (RSIP): Get the AI to write something, then critique its own work, then rewrite it better. Repeat. It's like making the AI its own editor. Context-Aware Decomposition (CAD): For super complex problems, you tell the AI to break it into smaller chunks but keep the big picture in mind, almost like it's keeping a \"thinking journal.\" Meta-Prompting (AI-ception!): This is where it gets really wild – using AIs to help write better prompts for other AIs. Think \"Automatic Prompt Engineer\" (APE) where an AI tries out tons of prompts and picks the best one.   Hot Trends in Prompting: AI Designing Prompts: More tools are using AI to suggest or even create prompts for you.   Mega-Prompts: New AIs can handle HUGE amounts of text (think novels worth of info!). So, people are stuffing prompts with tons of context for super detailed answers.   Adaptive & Multimodal: Prompts that change based on the conversation, and prompts that work with images, audio, and video, not just text.   Ethical Prompting: A big push to design prompts that reduce bias and make AI outputs fairer and safer.   Part 2: The Big Headaches & What's Next for Prompts It's not all smooth sailing. Getting these AIs to do exactly what we want, safely and reliably, is still a massive challenge. The \"Oops, I Sneezed and the AI Broke\" Problem: AIs are still super sensitive to tiny changes in prompts. This \"prompt brittleness\" is a nightmare if you need consistent results.   Making AI Work for REAL Jobs: Enterprise Data: AIs that ace public tests can fall flat on their face with messy, real-world company data. They just don't get the internal jargon or complex setups.   Coding Help: Developers often struggle to tell AI coding assistants exactly what they want, leading to frustrating back-and-forth. Tools like \"AutoPrompter\" are trying to help by guessing the missing info from the code itself.   Science & Medicine: Getting AIs to do real scientific reasoning or give trustworthy medical info needs super careful prompting. You need accuracy AND explanations you can trust.   Security Alert! Prompt Injection: This is a big one. Bad actors can hide malicious instructions in text (like an email the AI reads) to trick the AI into leaking info or doing harmful things. It's a constant cat-and-mouse game.   So, What's the Future of Prompts? More Automation: Less manual crafting, more AI-assisted prompt design.   Tougher & Smarter Prompts: Making them more robust, reliable, and better at complex reasoning. Specialization: Prompts designed for very specific jobs and industries. Efficiency & Ethics: Getting good results without burning a million GPUs, and doing it responsibly. Part 3: The AI Models Themselves are Leveling Up – BIG TIME! It's not just how we talk to them; the AIs themselves are evolving at a dizzying pace. The Big Players & The Disruptors: OpenAI (GPT series), Google DeepMind (Gemini), Meta AI (Llama), and Anthropic (Claude) are still the heavyweights. But keep an eye on Mistral AI, AI21 Labs, Cohere, and a whole universe of open-source contributors.   Under the Hood – Fancy New Brains: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE): Think of it like having a team of specialized mini-brains inside the AI. Only the relevant \"experts\" fire up for a given task. This means models can be HUGE (like Mistral's Mixtral 8x22B or Databricks' DBRX) but still be relatively efficient to run. Meta's Llama 4 is also rumored to use this.   State Space Models (SSM): Architectures like Mamba (seen in AI21 Labs' Jamba) are shaking things up, often mixed with traditional Transformer parts. They're good at handling long strings of information efficiently.   What These New AIs Can DO: Way Brainier: Models like OpenAI's \"o\" series (o1, o3, o4-mini), Google's Gemini 2.0/2.5, and Anthropic's Claude 3.7 are pushing the limits of reasoning, coding, math, and complex problem-solving. Some even try to show their \"thought process\".   MEGA-Memory (Context Windows): This is a game-changer. Google's Gemini 2.0 Pro can handle 2 million tokens (think of a token as roughly a word or part of a word). That's like feeding it multiple long books at once!. Others like OpenAI's GPT-4.1 and Anthropic's Claude series are also in the hundreds of thousands.   They Can See! And Hear! (Multimodality is HERE): AIs are no longer just text-in, text-out. They're processing images, audio, and even video.   OpenAI's Sora makes videos from text.   Google's Gemini family is natively multimodal.   Meta's Llama 3.2 Vision handles images, and Llama 4 is aiming to be an \"omni-model\".   Small but Mighty (Efficiency FTW!): Alongside giant models, there's a huge trend in creating smaller, super-efficient AIs that still pack a punch. Microsoft's Phi-3 series is a great example – its \"mini\" version (3.8B parameters) performs like much bigger models used to. This is awesome for running AI on your phone or for cheaper, faster applications.   Open Source is Booming: So many powerful models (Llama, Mistral, Gemma, Qwen, Falcon, etc.) are open source, meaning anyone can download, use, and even modify them. Hugging Face is the place to be for this.   Part 4: The Bigger Picture & What's Coming Down the Pike All this tech doesn't exist in a vacuum. Here's what the broader AI world looks like: Stanford's AI Index Report 2025 Says...    AI is crushing benchmarks, even outperforming humans in some timed coding tasks. It's everywhere: medical devices, self-driving cars, and 78% of businesses are using it (up from 55% the year before!). Money is POURING in, especially in the US. US still makes the most new models, but China's models are catching up FAST in quality. Responsible AI is... a mixed bag. Incidents are up, but new safety benchmarks are appearing. Governments are finally getting serious about rules. AI is getting cheaper and more efficient to run. People globally are getting more optimistic about AI, but big regional differences remain. It's All Connected: Better models allow for crazier prompts. Better prompting unlocks new ways to use these models. A great example is Agentic AI – AIs that can actually do things for you, like book flights or manage your email (think Google's Project Astra or Operator from OpenAI). These need smart models AND smart prompting.   Peeking into 2025 and Beyond: More Multimodal & Specialized AIs: Expect general-purpose AIs that can see, hear, and talk, alongside super-smart specialist AIs for things like medicine or law.   Efficiency is King: Models that are powerful and cheap to run will be huge.   Safety & Ethics Take Center Stage: As AI gets more powerful, making sure it's safe and aligned with human values will be a make-or-break issue.   AI On Your Phone (For Real This Time): More AI will run directly on your devices for instant responses.   New Computers? Quantum and neuromorphic computing might start to play a role in making AIs even better or more efficient.   TL;DR / So What? Basically, AI is evolving at a mind-blowing pace. How we \"prompt\" or instruct these AIs is becoming a complex skill in itself, almost a new kind of programming. And the AIs? They're getting incredibly powerful, understanding more than just text, remembering more, and reasoning better. We're also seeing a split between giant, do-everything models and smaller, super-efficient ones. It's an incredibly exciting time, but with all this power comes a ton of responsibility. We're still figuring out how to make these things reliable, fair, and safe. What are your thoughts? What AI developments are you most excited (or terrified) about?

About six months ago, I shared my 2024 list , which many readers found useful. So, I was thinking about doing this again. However, this time, I am incorporating that one piece of feedback kept coming up: \"Can you organize the papers by topic instead of date?\" The categories I came up with are: Reasoning Models - 1a. Training Reasoning Models - 1b. Inference-Time Reasoning Strategies - 1c. Evaluating LLMs and/or Understanding Reasoning Other Reinforcement Learning Methods for LLMs Other Inference-Time Scaling Methods Efficient Training & Architectures Diffusion-Based Language Models Multimodal & Vision-Language Models Data & Pre-training Datasets Also, as LLM research continues to be shared at a rapid pace, I have decided to break the list into bi-yearly updates. This way, the list stays digestible, timely, and hopefully useful for anyone looking for solid summer reading material. Please note that this is just a curated list for now. In future articles, I plan to revisit and discuss some of the more interesting or impactful papers in larger topic-specific write-ups. Stay tuned! Announcement: It's summer! And that means internship season, tech interviews, and lots of learning. To support those brushing up on intermediate to advanced machine learning and AI topics, I have made all 30 chapters of my Machine Learning Q and AI book freely available for the summer: 🔗 https://sebastianraschka.com/books/ml-q-and-ai/#table-of-contents Whether you are just curious and want to learn something new or prepping for interviews, hopefully this comes in handy.

As we look to 2025, large language models (LLMs) are at the center of a technological revolution that promises not only to transform industries but also to redefine our daily interactions with machines. With unprecedented advances in efficiency, sustainability, and application-specific customization, LLMs are evolving from experimental prototypes into indispensable tools that power everything from chatbots and content creation to autonomous agents and data analytics. In this post, we explore the key trends that will define LLM development in 2025, highlight eye-opening statistics and expert quotes, and consider both the exciting opportunities and critical challenges that lie ahead. 1. The Evolution of LLMs: From Research Prototypes to Ubiquitous Tools Large language models have come a long way since the early days of statistical language modeling. Today’s LLMs — powered by transformer architectures — have grown in size, capability, and complexity. They are no longer just academic curiosities; they are deployed across industries and are reshaping workflows in finance, healthcare, retail, manufacturing, and more. As noted on Wikipedia, LLMs are “designed for natural language processing tasks such as language generation” and have demonstrated impressive abilities in predicting syntax, semantics, and even generating creative content. Yet with all this power comes a set of challenges — from resource consumption and training costs to ethical issues and potential misuse. In 2025, the focus will be as much on refining and securing these models as it is on scaling them up. 2. Efficiency and Sustainability: The Next Frontier Smaller Models, Bigger Impact One of the most compelling trends is the drive toward creating smaller, more efficient LLMs. Today’s LLMs can consume tremendous amounts of energy and require vast computational resources — a reality that has spurred a push for “Green AI.” For instance, Goldman Sachs has predicted that data center power demand could soar by 160% by 2030, making efficiency not just a cost issue but also an environmental imperative. Innovative startups are already demonstrating that it is possible to build models with comparable performance at a fraction of the cost. DeepSeek — a Chinese AI startup — recently showcased its DeepSeek-R1 model, a 671-billion-parameter reasoning model that achieved performance similar to high-end models from tech giants yet with significantly lower inference costs. According to sellside commentary, DeepSeek’s approach “breaks the AI capex narrative” by reducing training costs from billions to just a few million dollars. Sustainability in AI: Cutting Energy Use The drive toward sustainability in AI development has spurred research into optimizing training techniques, improving hardware efficiency, and even exploring alternative energy sources for data centers. With inference costs dropping by an order of magnitude each year — a trend highlighted by Wired — developers are poised to create LLM-powered apps that are not only powerful but also cost-effective and environmentally friendly. 3. Specialization and Customization: Domain-Specific LLMs Verticalized AI Solutions As industries mature in their adoption of AI, there is a growing demand for LLMs that are tailored to specific applications. Instead of relying solely on general-purpose models like GPT-4, businesses are increasingly turning to domain-specific LLMs. These models can be fine-tuned with proprietary data to improve accuracy, compliance, and efficiency in tasks ranging from financial forecasting and fraud detection to personalized healthcare diagnostics. For example, in finance, specialized LLMs are being used to detect irregular transaction patterns and monitor compliance in real time. A recent survey found that by 2025, it is estimated that 50% of digital work in financial institutions will be automated using such models, leading to faster decision-making and reduced operational costs. Customizable Models for Enhanced Performance Customization is not only about tailoring models to industries but also about improving the end-user experience. Companies are now offering APIs and fine-tuning services that allow organizations to “own” an LLM that speaks their language — both literally and figuratively. For instance, a retail company might fine-tune its LLM to better understand product descriptions and customer reviews, thereby delivering highly personalized shopping recommendations. This trend of customization is paving the way for more human-like interactions and greater trust in AI systems. 4. Multimodal Capabilities: Beyond Text Integration of Text, Image, Audio, and Video LLMs are no longer confined to processing and generating text. The next generation of models will be truly multimodal, capable of integrating text with images, audio, and even video. This evolution is crucial for applications such as virtual assistants, medical diagnostics, and interactive media. Imagine an AI that can not only answer your questions but also analyze visual data from medical scans or generate multimedia content on the fly. Recent advancements suggest that multimodal LLMs will soon enable richer, more complex user experiences, merging the best of natural language processing with computer vision and audio processing. Cross-Language and Cross-Domain Translation The ability to work seamlessly across languages and domains is another hallmark of the upcoming multimodal revolution. In 2025, LLMs will be able to process information in multiple languages, breaking down barriers in global communication. This capability will be particularly transformative for multinational companies and global research collaborations, where real-time, accurate translation is paramount. 5. Responsible and Ethical AI Development Bias Mitigation and Fairness With great power comes great responsibility. LLMs are only as good as the data they are trained on, and that data often contains biases. Experts warn that these models can inadvertently reinforce harmful stereotypes or produce biased outputs. In response, the industry is placing a strong emphasis on bias mitigation and fairness. Tech leaders are exploring advanced techniques such as fairness-aware training, enhanced data curation, and continuous monitoring of deployed models. For instance, initiatives from organizations like OWASP are now providing updated “Top 10 Risks” for LLMs to help developers secure their systems against vulnerabilities and biases. Data Privacy, Security, and Transparency In a world increasingly concerned with privacy, LLMs must operate within strict data protection frameworks. Data privacy and security are not optional extras but critical components of AI development. Companies are now adopting methods such as federated learning and differential privacy to ensure that AI systems can learn from data without compromising user confidentiality. Moreover, transparency in how these models make decisions is vital. Research is underway to develop explainable AI (XAI) techniques that allow users to understand the reasoning behind an LLM’s output — a crucial step in building trust and ensuring regulatory compliance. 6. Autonomous Agents: The New Frontier of Productivity Agents that Act on Your Behalf Perhaps one of the most exciting trends for 2025 is the rise of autonomous agents. These are AI-powered systems that can perform complex tasks — such as making purchases, scheduling meetings, or even handling customer support — without constant human intervention. At the Reuters NEXT conference in New York, business executives forecast that autonomous agents will dominate the AI agenda next year. OpenAI CFO Sarah Friar stated, “I think we are going to see a lot of motion next year around agents, and I think people are going to be surprised at how fast this technology comes at us”. Real-World Productivity Gains The promise of autonomous agents lies in their ability to drive significant productivity gains. Companies like Relevance AI are already using these systems to reimagine back-office functions and front-office customer interactions. By automating routine tasks, businesses can reduce labor costs dramatically. One study reported that by integrating LLM-powered agents, organizations have been able to increase their margins substantially while reducing the time spent on mundane tasks. Furthermore, as these agents become more capable, experts predict that artificial general intelligence (AGI) could be achieved in the coming few years — ushering in an era where machines not only assist but also enhance human decision-making at an unprecedented scale. 7. Advances in Training and Fine-Tuning Techniques Few-Shot and Zero-Shot Learning Training large language models traditionally required vast datasets and significant computational power. However, recent advances in few-shot and zero-shot learning have dramatically reduced these requirements. These techniques allow models to generalize from very few examples, enabling faster deployment and more agile updates. This is particularly important for businesses that need to rapidly adapt to changing market conditions without incurring massive retraining costs. Reinforcement Learning and Reasoning Models A breakthrough in LLM research has been the development of “reasoning models.” OpenAI’s recent o1 model, for instance, demonstrated significant improvements in mathematics, science, and coding tasks by generating detailed, step-by-step solutions before arriving at an answer. This trend is complemented by innovations from companies like DeepSeek, which released its R1 model that leverages reinforcement learning to achieve high performance at a fraction of the cost of its competitors. These models are not only more effective but also more cost-efficient — a win-win for enterprises looking to maximize ROI. 8. Market Impact and Economic Forecasts Explosive Growth and Investment Surge The global market for AI is projected to skyrocket in the coming years. Recent reports indicate that the global LLM market could grow from USD 6.4 billion in 2024 to over USD 36.1 billion by 2030 — a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of more than 33%. North America alone is forecasted to hit astonishing numbers, with some estimates predicting the market could reach over USD 105 billion by 2030. Venture capital investments are also surging. As LLMs continue to demonstrate their transformative potential, investors are increasingly backing startups that focus on developing efficient, scalable, and domain-specific models. The sellside analysis of DeepSeek, for example, has drawn attention to how innovative, cost-effective AI can upend traditional capex models, forcing even tech giants to rethink their strategies. Economic and Societal Benefits Beyond corporate balance sheets, the economic impact of LLMs will be felt across society. Goldman Sachs has suggested that generative AI could boost global GDP by as much as 7% over the next decade. Furthermore, the proliferation of AI-powered applications is expected to create new job categories while simultaneously automating routine tasks — an effect that has been compared to past technological revolutions like the advent of personal computing and mobile internet. 9. Security and Risk Mitigation The OWASP Top 10 for LLM Security As LLMs become more integral to business and society, ensuring their security is paramount. OWASP’s updated Top 10 list for LLMs in 2025 highlights a range of risks — from resource mismanagement (unbounded consumption) to system prompt leakage and excessive agency. These guidelines are critical for developers to understand and mitigate vulnerabilities in AI applications. Mitigating Misinformation and Bias Security concerns are not limited to technical vulnerabilities. Misinformation, political bias, and the potential for harmful outputs are significant challenges that developers and policymakers must address. By incorporating robust safety measures — such as advanced content filtering, bias audits, and explainability protocols — companies can safeguard against these risks while continuing to innovate. A recent study noted that models like ChatGPT occasionally “hallucinate” or generate inaccurate information, underscoring the need for continuous monitoring and human oversight. These challenges have spurred collaborative efforts among researchers, industry leaders, and regulatory bodies to develop best practices for responsible AI deployment. 10. Looking Ahead: Predictions for 2025 and Beyond The Road to AGI One of the most ambitious predictions for the coming years is the eventual achievement of artificial general intelligence (AGI). While current LLMs still face significant limitations — especially in long-term planning and complex reasoning — advances in step-by-step reasoning models and reinforcement learning are gradually closing the gap. OpenAI CFO Sarah Friar recently expressed optimism that AGI could be “in the shorter term,” suggesting that machines capable of outperforming humans in economically valuable tasks might be closer than we think. A New Era of Autonomous Agents By 2025, the rise of autonomous agents is expected to transform the way we interact with technology. These agents will be integrated into daily workflows, handling everything from scheduling and purchasing to customer service and data analysis. As these systems become more sophisticated, they will not only enhance productivity but also pave the way for entirely new business models. With LLMs driving this change, we may soon witness a world where human and machine collaboration is seamless and ubiquitous. Democratization of AI Perhaps the most promising trend is the democratization of AI. With the development of smaller, more efficient models and the proliferation of open-source projects, cutting-edge AI technology will become accessible to a much broader range of users. This democratization is likely to spur innovation across industries and empower smaller companies and individual developers to create AI applications that were once the exclusive domain of tech giants. Conclusion As we stand on the cusp of 2025, the landscape for large language models is one of both excitement and responsibility. On one hand, we are witnessing unprecedented advances in efficiency, specialization, multimodal integration, and autonomous agent capabilities. On the other hand, the challenges of energy consumption, security risks, bias, and ethical considerations remind us that with great power comes great responsibility. The trends discussed — from the rise of sustainable, cost-effective models to the emergence of domain-specific and multimodal AI, and the push toward autonomous agents — are set to redefine how we interact with technology. With significant economic and societal benefits on the horizon, the next few years promise to be transformative. As investments surge and new use cases emerge, the global impact of LLMs will only continue to grow. Whether you are an industry leader, a developer, or simply an AI enthusiast, 2025 will be a pivotal year. Embracing these trends responsibly, while staying vigilant about security and ethical issues, will be key to harnessing the full potential of AI. In the words of Reuters’ Sarah Friar, “Agents who are really there to help you with day to day tasks” are just the beginning of what AI can do — and this is only the start of a long journey toward a more efficient, inclusive, and innovative future. Stay tuned as we continue to follow these developments and share insights into how large language models are not only changing the tech landscape but also reshaping our lives.

But how do they work? What are they capable of? And what should we look out for when using them? Read on and find out in this guide for LLMs in 2024. Jump ahead: Understanding Large Language Models What is a Large Language Model? How Do Large Language Models Work? Key Milestones in Large Language Model Development Capabilities of Large Language Models Challenges and Limitations of LLMs The Future of Language Models: What Comes Next? Understanding Large Language Models Let’s get the basics out of the way. Here we’ll define the large language model (LLM), explain how they work, and provide a timeline of key milestones in LLM development. What is a Large Language Model? A large language model, often abbreviated to LLM, is a type of artificial intelligence model designed to understand natural language as well as generate it at a large scale. When we say human language, we don’t just mean English, Spanish, or Cantonese. Those are certainly part of what LLMs are trained on but human language, in this context, also extends to: Art Dance Morse code Genetic code Hieroglyphics Cryptography Sign language Body language Musical notation Chemical signaling Emojis and symbols Animal communication Haptic communications Traffic signs and signals Mathematical equations Programming languages LLMs are trained on billions of parameters and have the ability to learn from a wide range of data sources. This extensive training enables them to predict and produce text based on the input they receive so that they can engage in conversations, answer queries, or even write code. Some of the leading very large models include giants like GPT, LLaMa, LaMDA, PaLM 2, BERT, and ERNIE. They’re at the heart of various applications, aiding in everything from customer service chatbots to content creation and software development. Some companies even build their own LLMs but that requires significant time, investment, and tech knowledge. It’s much easier to integrate a pre-trained LLM into your own systems. How Do Large Language Models Work? Large Language Models use a blend of neural networks and machine learning (ML). It’s this blend that allows the technology to first process and then generate original text and imagery. Think of neural networks as the LLM’s brain. It’s these networks that learn from vast amounts of data, improving over time as they’re exposed to more. As the model is trained on more data, it learns patterns, structures, and the nuances of language. It’s like teaching it the rules of grammar, the rhythm of poetry, and the jargon of technical manuals all at once. Machine learning models then help the model to predict the next word in a sentence based on the words that come before it. This is done countless times, refining the model’s ability to generate coherent and contextually relevant text. LLMs now also operate on a Transformer Architecture. This architecture allows the model to look at and weigh the importance of different words in a sentence. It’s the same as when we read a sentence and look for context clues to understand its meaning. ⚠️ While LLMs can generate original content, the quality, relevance, and innovativeness of their output can vary and require human oversight and refinement. The originality is also influenced by how the prompts are structured, the model’s training data, and the specific capabilities of the LLM in question. Key Milestones in Large Language Model Development Large language models haven’t always been as useful as they are today. They’ve developed and been iterated upon significantly over time. Let’s look at some of those key moments in LLM history. That way you can appreciate how far they’ve come and the rapid evolution in the last few years compared to decades of slow progress. 1966 ELIZA The first chatbot created by Joseph Weizenbaum, simulating a psychotherapist in conversation. 2013 word2vec A groundbreaking tool developed by a team led by Tomas Mikolov at Google, introducing efficient methods for learning word embeddings from raw text. 2018 GPT and BERT GPT (Generative Pretrained Transformer): OpenAI introduced GPT, showcasing a powerful model for understanding and generating human-like text.

It’s also more accessible to larger numbers of people. Capabilities of Large Language Models The capabilities of Large Language Models are as vast as the datasets they’re trained on. Use cases range from generating code to suggesting strategy for a product launch and analyzing data points. This is because LLMs serve as foundation models that can be applied across multiple uses. Here’s a list of LLM capabilities: Text generation Language translation Summarization Question answering Sentiment analysis Conversational agents Code generation and explanation Named entity recognition Text classification Content recommendation Language modeling Spell checking and grammar correction Paraphrasing and rewriting Keyword and phrase extraction Dialogue systems And here’s a breakdown of some of the more common ones we see: Automated Code Generation LLMs can generate code snippets, functions, or even entire modules based on natural language descriptions, reducing the time and effort required to implement common functionalities. Here’s an example to illustrate how LLMs can be used for automated code generation: Prompt: “Write a Python function that takes a list of numbers as input and returns a list containing only the even numbers.” Text Generation LLMs can generate coherent, contextually relevant text based on prompts. This includes creating articles, stories, and even generating product descriptions. Here’s an example to illustrate how LLMs can be used for text generation: Prompt: “Generate a product description for a cutting-edge smartwatch designed for fitness enthusiasts. The description should highlight its advanced health and fitness tracking, personalized coaching, long battery life, durability, connectivity features, and customizable design. Target the description to appeal to both seasoned athletes and beginners interested in tracking their fitness progress.” Language Translation They can translate text between different languages, often with a high degree of accuracy, depending on the languages involved and the model’s training data. Here’s an example to illustrate how LLMs can be used for language translation: Prompt: “Translate the following English text into Spanish: ‘The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.'” Bug Detection and Correction LLMs can help identify bugs in code by analyzing code patterns and suggesting fixes for common errors, potentially integrating with IDEs (Integrated Development Environments) to provide real-time assistance. Here’s an example to illustrate how LLMs can be used for bug detection: Prompt: “The Python function below intends to return the nth Fibonacci number. Please identify and correct any bugs in the function. Python Function: def fibonacci(n): if n <= 1: return n else: return fibonacci(n – 1) + fibonacci(n – 2)” Paraphrasing and Rewriting They can rephrase or rewrite text while maintaining the original meaning, useful for content creation and academic purposes. Here’s an example to illustrate how LLMs can be used for paraphrasing: Prompt: “Rewrite the following sentence in a simpler and more concise way without losing its original meaning: ‘The comprehensive study on climate change incorporates a wide array of data, including historical weather patterns, satellite imagery, and computer model predictions, to provide a holistic view of the impacts of global warming.'” Dialogue Systems LLMs power sophisticated dialogue systems for customer service, interactive storytelling, and educational purposes, providing responses that can adapt to the user’s input. Think of a chatbot on a software product you use where you can ask it questions and it generates insightful, helpful responses. Challenges and Limitations of LLMs Large language models have come a long way since the early days of Eliza. In the last two years alone, we’ve seen LLMs power Generative AI and create high-quality text, music, video, and images. But with any technology, there will always be growing pains. Technical Limitations of Language Models Large Language Models sometimes face technical limitations impacting their accuracy and ability to understand context. Domain Mismatch Models trained on broad datasets may struggle with specific or niche subjects due to a lack of detailed data in those areas. This can lead to inaccuracies or overly generic responses when dealing with specialized knowledge. Word Prediction LLMs often falter with less common words or phrases, impacting their ability to fully understand or accurately generate text involving these terms. This limitation can affect the quality of translation, writing, and technical documentation tasks. Real-time Translation Efficiency While LLMs have made strides in translation accuracy, the computational demands of processing and generating translations in real-time can strain resources , especially for languages with complex grammatical structures or those less represented in training data. Hallucinations and Bias On occasion, LLM technology is too original. So original in fact that it’s making up information. This is a lesson Air Canada learned the hard way when its chatbot told a customer about a refund policy when no such policy exists, which they then had to honor. Finally, LLMs can inadvertently propagate and amplify biases present in their training data, leading to outputs that may be discriminatory or offensive. Scalability and Environmental Impact The scalability of LLMs is tied to the impact it has on the environment. And that impact is turning out to be a big one. Training a system like GPT-3 took 1,287 Megawatt hours (MWh) of energy. To put that into perspective, 1 MWh could power about 330 homes for one hour in the United States. The image below shows the energy consumption of training four different LLMs. Energy consumption doesn’t end at training—operating LLMs also uses a grotesque level of energy. In one report, Alex de Vries , founder of Digiconomist, has calculated that by 2027 the AI sector will consume between 85 to 134 Terawatt hours each year. That’s almost the same as the annual energy demand of the Netherlands. We can’t help but wonder how sustainable that is and what the long-term environmental impact will be on our energy sources. Especially when you consider LLMs are only going to become larger and more complex as we advance their capabilities. And to maintain large language models, we’ll need to update them with new data and parameters as they arise. That will only expend more energy and resources. The Future of Language Models: What Comes Next? Now that we’ve seen drastic and rapid improvement in the capabilities of LLMs through Generative AI, we expect users of AI to be fine-tuning prompts and discovering new use cases and applications. In the workplace especially, the focus will be on productivity hacks. It’s something we experiment with already through our Generative Driven Development™ offering, where our team has increased the productivity of software development by 30-50%. Hilary Ashton, Chief Product Officer at Teradata, shared her predictions for the future of LLMs and AI in AI Magazine : First, I foresee a massive productivity leap forward through GenAI, especially in technology and software. It’s getting more cost-effective to get into GenAI, and there are lots more solutions available that can help improve GenAI solutions. It will be the year when conversations gravitate to GenAI, ethics, and what it means to be human. In some cases, we’ll start to see the workforce shift and be reshaped, with the technology helping to usher in a four-day work week for some full-time employees.” Hilary Ashton And she’s right, especially when it comes to ethical considerations and where we humans add value AI can’t replicate. We’ll also see further democratization of AI with it infiltrating other areas of our life, much the same the computer has done since its invention. What we know for certain is the development of LLMs and Generative AI is only getting started. And we want to be leading conversations on its use, ethics, scalability, and more as it evolves. You can be part of that conversation too: Listen or watch our Talking AI podcast where we interview AI experts and talk or sign up for our newsletter where we share insights and developments on LLMs, AI/ML, and Data governance, curated by our very own CTO, Omar Shanti.

    "content": "What is Data Science? | IBM Analytics What is data science? What is data science? Data science combines math and statistics, specialized programming, advanced analytics , artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning with specific subject matter expertise to uncover actionable insights hidden in an organization’s data. These insights can be used to guide decision making and strategic planning. The accelerating volume of data sources, and subsequently data, has made data science is one of the fastest growing field across every industry. As a result, it is no surprise that the role of the data scientist was dubbed the “sexiest job of the 21st century” by Harvard Business Review . Organizations are increasingly reliant on them to interpret data and provide actionable recommendations to improve business outcomes. The data science lifecycle involves various roles, tools, and processes, which enables analysts to glean actionable insights. Typically, a data science project undergoes the following stages: Data ingestion : The lifecycle begins with the data collection, both raw structured and unstructured data from all relevant sources using a variety of methods. These methods can include manual entry, web scraping, and real-time streaming data from systems and devices. Data sources can include structured data, such as customer data, along with unstructured data like log files, video, audio, pictures, the Internet of Things (IoT) , social media, and more. Data storage and data processing : Since data can have different formats and structures, companies need to consider different storage systems based on the type of data that needs to be captured. Data management teams help to set standards around data storage and structure, which facilitate workflows around analytics, machine learning and deep learning models. This stage includes cleaning data, deduplicating, transforming and combining the data using ETL (extract, transform, load) jobs or other data integration technologies. This data preparation is essential for promoting data quality before loading into a data warehouse , data lake , or other repository. Data analysis : Here, data scientists conduct an exploratory data analysis to examine biases, patterns, ranges, and distributions of values within the data. This data analytics exploration drives hypothesis generation for a/b testing. It also allows analysts to determine the data’s relevance for use within modeling efforts for predictive analytics, machine learning, and/or deep learning. Depending on a model’s accuracy, organizations can become reliant on these insights for business decision making, allowing them to drive more scalability. Communicate : Finally, insights are presented as reports and other data visualizations that make the insights and their impact on business easier for business analysts and other decision-makers to understand. A data science programming language such as R or Python includes components for generating visualizations; alternately, data scientists can use dedicated visualization tools.

They possess computer science and pure science skills beyond those of a typical business analyst or data analyst, as well as a deep understanding of the specifics of the industry or business discipline in which they work (such as automobile manufacturing, eCommerce or healthcare). A data scientist must be able to: Know enough about the business to ask pertinent questions and identify business pain points. Apply statistics and computer science, along with business acumen, to data analysis. Use a wide range of tools and techniques for preparing and extracting data, everything from databases and SQL to data mining to data integration methods. Extract insights from big data using predictive analytics and artificial intelligence (AI), including machine learning models , natural language processing , and deep learning . Write programs and algorithms that automate data processing and calculations. Tell and illustrate stories that clearly convey the meaning of results to decision-makers and stakeholders at every level of technical understanding. Explain how the results can be used to solve business problems. Collaborate with other data science team members, such as data and business analysts, IT architects, data engineers, and application developers. These skills are in high demand, and as a result, many individuals that are breaking into a data science career, explore a variety of data science programs, such as certification programs, data science courses, and degree programs offered by educational institutions. Data scientists are not necessarily directly responsible for all the processes involved in the data science lifecycle. For example, data pipelines are typically handled by data engineers, but the data scientist may make recommendations about what sort of data is useful or required. While data scientists can build machine learning models, scaling these efforts at a larger level requires more software engineering skills to optimize a program to run more quickly. As a result, it’s common for a data scientist to partner with machine learning engineers to scale machine learning models. Data scientist responsibilities can commonly overlap with a data analyst, particularly with exploratory data analysis and data visualization. However, a data scientist’s skillset is typically broader than the average data analyst. Comparatively speaking, data scientist leverage common programming languages, such as R and Python, to conduct more statistical inference and data visualization.

Watch all episodes of Mixture of Experts Data science versus business intelligence It may be easy to confuse the terms “data science” and “business intelligence” (BI) because they both relate to an organization’s data and analysis of that data, but they do differ in focus. Business intelligence (BI) is typically an umbrella term for the technology that enables data preparation, data mining, data management, and data visualization. Business intelligence tools and processes allow end users to identify actionable information from raw data, facilitating data-driven decision-making within organizations across various industries. While data science tools overlap in much of this regard, business intelligence focuses more on data from the past, and the insights from BI tools are more descriptive in nature. It uses data to understand what happened before to inform a course of action. BI is geared toward static (unchanging) data that is usually structured. While data science uses descriptive data, it typically utilizes it to determine predictive variables, which are then used to categorize data or to make forecasts. Data science and BI are not mutually exclusive, digitally savvy organizations use both to fully understand and extract value from their data. Data science tools Data scientists rely on popular programming languages to conduct exploratory data analysis and statistical regression. These open source tools support pre-built statistical modeling, machine learning, and graphics capabilities. These languages include the following (read more at \" Python vs. R: What's the Difference? \"): R Studio: An open source programming language and environment for developing statistical computing and graphics. Python: It is a dynamic and flexible programming language. The Python includes numerous libraries, such as NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, for analyzing data quickly. To facilitate sharing code and other information, data scientists may use GitHub and Jupyter notebooks. Some data scientists may prefer a user interface, and two common enterprise tools for statistical analysis include: SAS: A comprehensive tool suite, including visualizations and interactive dashboards, for analyzing, reporting, data mining, and predictive modeling. IBM SPSS : Offers advanced statistical analysis, a large library of machine learning algorithms, text analysis, open source extensibility, integration with big data, and seamless deployment into applications. Data scientists also gain proficiency in using big data processing platforms, such as Apache Spark, the open source framework Apache Hadoop, and NoSQL databases. They are also skilled with a wide range of data visualization tools, including simple graphics tools included with business presentation and spreadsheet applications (like Microsoft Excel), built-for-purpose commercial visualization tools like Tableau and IBM Cognos, and open source tools like D3.js (a JavaScript library for creating interactive data visualizations) and RAW Graphs. For building machine learning models, data scientists frequently turn to several frameworks like PyTorch, TensorFlow, MXNet, and Spark MLib. Given the steep learning curve in data science, many companies are seeking to accelerate their return on investment for AI projects; they often struggle to hire the talent needed to realize data science project’s full potential. To address this gap, they are turning to multipersona data science and machine learning (DSML) platforms, giving rise to the role of “citizen data scientist.” Multipersona DSML platforms use automation, self-service portals, and low-code/no-code user interfaces so that people with little or no background in digital technology or expert data science can create business value using data science and machine learning. These platforms also support expert data scientists by also offering a more technical interface. Using a multipersona DSML platform encourages collaboration across the enterprise. Data science and cloud computing Cloud computing scales data science by providing access to additional processing power, storage, and other tools required for data science projects. Since data science frequently leverages large data sets, tools that can scale with the size of the data is incredibly important, particularly for time-sensitive projects. Cloud storage solutions, such as data lakes, provide access to storage infrastructure, which are capable of ingesting and processing large volumes of data with ease. These storage systems provide flexibility to end users, allowing them to spin up large clusters as needed. They can also add incremental compute nodes to expedite data processing jobs, allowing the business to make short-term tradeoffs for a larger long-term outcome. Cloud platforms typically have different pricing models, such a per-use or subscriptions, to meet the needs of their end user, whether they are a large enterprise or a small startup. Open source technologies are widely used in data science tool sets. When they’re hosted in the cloud, teams don’t need to install, configure, maintain, or update them locally. Several cloud providers, including IBM Cloud®, also offer prepackaged tool kits that enable data scientists to build models without coding, further democratizing access to technology innovations and data insights. Data science use cases Enterprises can unlock numerous benefits from data science. Common use cases include process optimization through intelligent automation and enhanced targeting and personalization to improve the customer experience (CX). However, more specific examples include: Here are a few representative use cases for data science and artificial intelligence: An international bank delivers faster loan services with a mobile app using machine learning-powered credit risk models and a hybrid cloud computing architecture that is both powerful and secure. An electronics firm is developing ultra-powerful 3D-printed sensors to guide tomorrow’s driverless vehicles. The solution relies on data science and analytics tools to enhance its real-time object detection capabilities.

That is data science, and it's all around us! Definition and purpose of data science The U.S. Census Bureau defines data science as \"a field of study that uses scientific methods, processes, and systems to extract knowledge and insights from data.\" So, this is a field that works with data that doesn't fit neatly into rows and columns—and, in the end, derives relevant information from it. Data science is inherently interdisciplinary as it combines expertise from statistics, computer science, mathematics, and domain-specific knowledge. This makes it incredibly versatile, with applications spanning healthcare, finance, marketing, and even environmental research. For instance, a data scientist in public health can analyze demographic data in order to make predictions about the spread of a disease. Similarly, in the business sector, data science guides personalized marketing strategies by working with data related to customer behavior. Nowadays, there is an overwhelming amount of data generated—millions of terabytes every day. It's often produced through everyday activities like scrolling through social media or buying something online. Each action leaves behind bits of information, like breadcrumbs, that systems gather and hold onto. But here's the thing: all this information doesn't come neatly organized and ready to work with. At first, it's just a chaotic mix of numbers, texts, and signals that need to be sorted and shaped into something meaningful before it's actually useful. Therefore, the purpose of data science is to work with some of that data and drive better-informed decision-making. History of data science Data science is often considered the intersection between statistics and computer science because its history is rooted in these two fields, and they share many of the same principles. In 1974, Peter Naur, a computer science pioneer, introduced the term \"data science\" in his book \"Concise Survey of Computer Methods\" as an alternative to \"computer science.\" Whereas in 1997, Jeff Wu called for statistics to be renamed data science and statisticians to data scientists. So, it was the convergence of statistics and computer science, coupled with technological advances, that paved the way for modern data science. However, when discussing the history of data science, many start with mathematical statistician John W. Tukey's \"The Future of Data Analysis.\" This 1962 paper signaled a call for a reformation of academic statistics, as Tukey argued that what he referred to then as data analysis was more than just mathematics. According to him, it was an empirical science, focusing on deriving meaning from data rather than just theoretical modeling. This perspective set the foundation for what would later become known as data science​. Later, in 1977, the International Association for Statistical Computing (IASC) was created. Their mission statement was \"to link traditional statistical methodology, modern computer technology, and the knowledge of domain experts in order to convert data into information and knowledge.\" Around the same time, advancements in data visualization and exploratory data analysis, particularly with Tukey's publication of \"Exploratory Data Analysis,\" further brought to light the importance of using data for hypothesis generation and testing​. The field continued to grow, and by the late 1990s, the term \"data science\" had gained broader recognition​. In 2001, American computer scientist and professor William S. Cleveland outlined a broader vision for statistics that shifted from the traditional theoretical one to a more applied, data-centric focus​. This way, a new field would emerge that integrated elements of machine learning, visualization, and computing. The emergence of big data in the early 21st century truly cemented data science as the discipline for working with and making sense of complex, large-scale information, ultimately becoming what many consider the \" fourth paradigm \" of scientific discovery, following experimental, theoretical, and computational science. The Data Science Life Cycle We're all familiar with life cycles—whether it's the natural stages of growth in living beings or the progression of a product from creation to completion. They're processes that start with one form, go through several phases of development or change, and eventually reach an endpoint or transformation. In the same way, data science has its own life cycle. The data science life cycle represents the systematic process data goes through to be transformed into meaningful insights. Like all other life cycles, it's a structured cycle in which each phase builds on the last to reach the final results. Step-by-step process in data science The data science life cycle encompasses five key steps that data must go through in order to provide valuable insights. These steps are: Obtaining data The first step in the data science life cycle is obtaining the data. Data scientists can collect data from a variety of sources, including databases, sensors, APIs (application programming interfaces), and online platforms. At this stage, the most important thing is ensuring that you have the right information to work with. So, you should gather data that is relevant to the problem you're trying to solve to avoid wasting time and effort with all the other steps that follow. Cleaning data After the data is collected, data scientists clean and preprocess it. This step, often referred to as data cleaning or wrangling, requires data scientists to format the data for analysis and deal with missing values, duplicates, and other errors. Data scientists spend a significant portion of the cycle at this stage, as cleaning and preparing the data guarantees that it will be both usable and reliable—key prerequisites for achieving good results. Exploring data At this stage, the data is ready, so data scientists begin the so-called exploratory data analysis (EDA) process. The aim is to understand the data's underlying structures and main characteristics and identify patterns. Depending on the number of variables analyzed at a time, EDA can utilize univariate, bivariate, or multivariate analysis. The goal is to better understand the data and develop hypotheses to guide model building or further analyses. Modeling data Next, data scientists use machine learning algorithms or different statistical techniques in order to predict outcomes or explain relationships within the data. Depending on the problem, these models can be predictive, such as forecasting future sales, or descriptive, such as clustering customers by behavior. Interpreting results If all previous steps are done correctly, data scientists should have produced results by the end of the cycle, and all that is left to do is interpret the conclusions and communicate them to the rest of the team. Communication plays a huge role at this stage, as all insights should be presented in a clear and concise manner so that stakeholders can understand them and be able to use them to aid decision-making. Data Science Tools and Technologies Data scientists have an array of tools and technologies to tackle various challenges. The choice of tools often depends on the type of data, the problem to solve, and the stage of the data science life cycle. Tools used in data science: Python and R Python and R are foundational programming languages in data science. Python is valued for its simplicity, versatility, and extensive libraries for data manipulation, machine learning, and visualization. R excels in statistical analysis and creating high-quality visualizations, making it ideal for research and exploratory analysis. SQL SQL (Structured Query Language) is essential for working with databases. It allows data scientists to query, retrieve, and manipulate structured data efficiently, making it a cornerstone for organizing and analyzing data. Big data technologies Technologies like Apache Spark and Databricks enable distributed processing and analysis of massive datasets. Cloud platforms such as AWS, Google Cloud, and Azure amplify these capabilities with scalable infrastructure and tools tailored for modern big data and machine learning workflows. Data visualization tools Visualization is essential for exploring data and presenting findings. Data scientists often rely on Python libraries like Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly, as well as R's ggplot2, for creating high-quality and customizable visualizations. For building interactive dashboards and sharing insights with non-technical stakeholders, tools like Tableau are popular and widely used. Machine learning platforms Frameworks such as TensorFlow, scikit-learn, and PyTorch streamline the development of machine learning models. From linear regression to deep neural networks, these platforms provide the tools to extract insights, automate processes, and make predictions. Learn about Harvard's Data Science Masters program Core Techniques in Data Science Depending on the focus and aim, the four core techniques of analysis used in data science are: Descriptive analysis This kind of analysis focuses on summarizing and describing a dataset's main features through averages, percentages, and frequencies. An example would be a retail company analyzing customer data to determine the average spending per customer. Diagnostic analysis Data scientists working in hospitals could use diagnostic analysis to investigate data and find out factors that lead to higher patient readmission rates in a specific department. The goal is to understand the causes of certain outcomes or trends. Predictive analysis By applying statistical models like regression or classification algorithms, data scientists can predict what is likely to happen in the future. For example, a company might use predictive analysis to estimate future sales or anticipate customer behavior based on past data patterns. Prescriptive analysis Prescriptive analysis goes a step beyond prediction by recommending actions based on data insights. This type of analysis helps businesses make decisions about resource allocation, strategic planning, or personalized customer recommendations. Career Opportunities in Data Science The skills and knowledge gained in data science are highly transferable. Therefore, with an education and experience in this field, professionals can pursue various careers in data science, including but not limited to the following: Data analyst Data analysts focus on interpreting and reporting historical data. Their primary responsibility is analyzing trends and patterns to produce insights that inform business decisions. They work with structured datasets, create visualizations, and generate reports that help stakeholders understand what has happened and why. Data scientist Building on the work of data analysts, data scientists go a step further by applying advanced analytical models and machine learning techniques to predict future trends and solve complex problems. They work with both structured and unstructured data, and their role often involves formulating hypotheses, designing experiments, and creating predictive models. Data scientists bridge the gap between interpreting historical data and generating forward-looking insights. Machine learning engineer Machine learning engineers specialize in operationalizing the models developed by data scientists. While data scientists focus on research and experimentation, machine learning engineers design, build, and deploy scalable systems that integrate machine learning algorithms into production environments. They also optimize model performance, manage large-scale datasets, and ensure the systems are reliable and efficient. Data engineer Data engineers provide the foundational infrastructure that supports the entire data life cycle. They design and manage data pipelines, ensure data quality, and integrate data from various sources. Their work enables data analysts, data scientists, and machine learning engineers to access reliable, high-quality data for their tasks. Data engineers are the architects of the data ecosystem, ensuring that data flows seamlessly and is accessible for analysis and modeling. Applications of Data Science Across Industries When we think of people working with data, the tech sector is often the first that comes to mind. However, while the tech industry is certainly a major hub for data scientists, the truth is that data science applications extend to a wide variety of industries. Data science in healthcare Metrics like temperature, heart rate, and brain activity are more easily analyzed when using data science methods. Therefore, data science can be applied in the healthcare industry to monitor patient health, predict outcomes, personalize treatments, and detect anomalies. Data science in finance Data science also makes a big difference in finance, particularly through insights into customer behaviors. For example, algorithms spot unusual patterns in transactions, thus flagging potential fraudulent activities. Many companies also use data science services in finance for algorithmic trading and risk analytics detection. Data science in environmental science Recently, data science has also become a powerful ally in environmental science. The insights extracted from data help experts deal with climate change modeling, resource management, and biodiversity tracking, among other things. Harvard's SEAS Environmental Science and Engineering program is an excellent degree option that teaches students about the interdisciplinary perspective needed to solve various environmental challenges. Data Science vs. Related Fields Data science often intersects with and complements other related fields. However, there are usually key differences between each field, defining their roles. Understanding these differences will help further clarify the all-important questions of \"What is data science?\" and \"What do data scientists do?\" Data science vs. data analytics Data science and data analytics both involve working with data, and the distinction between the two is so unclear that they are often used interchangeably. However, the latter is generally seen as a subset of data science since while data science deals with more complex techniques to analyze datasets to make future predictions and automate processes, data analytics tends to focus on interpreting and visualizing the data. Data science vs. machine learning Machine learning focuses on creating algorithms to learn from data without explicit programming and make predictions, which is crucial for data science. However, data science encompasses a broader range of techniques for extracting information from data, including machine learning algorithms, data wrangling, statistical analysis, and more. Data science vs. data engineering Data science and engineering also work with data, but they usually operate at different stages of the data process. While data engineers build the infrastructure for handling data, data scientists are focused on using that data in order to gain insights and use them for decision-making. Data science vs. statistics As seen when examining the field's history, statistics was the foundation of data science. However, while statistics focuses on understanding and explaining data, data science takes it a few steps further by using algorithms and computational tools to automate analysis, make predictions, and generate actionable insights. So, although data science often applies statistical concepts, it also involves machine learning, programming, and domain expertise. Learn about the Master's in Data Science at Harvard Why Is Data Science Important? Data science is invaluable in helping businesses and industries make better-informed choices. If a retailer uses data science to gain insights into customer purchasing patterns and adjusts inventory levels based on the results, then they can avoid overstocking or understocking. There are also instances when data science helps uncover patterns and trends that can inspire new products, services, or business strategies. Think of streaming platforms like Netflix—by analyzing their viewer data they can recommend personalized content, as well as have ideas about the creation of original programming that appeals to specific audiences. By identifying such trends, companies innovate and reduce costs by focusing on what truly adds value to their customers, whether that be optimizing supply chains or personalizing marketing efforts to increase conversions. Challenges in Data Science As we've established, data science brings many advantages to various industries. However, there is no rose without thorns, so to reap the benefits of data science, you must, from time to time, also deal with certain challenges. For example, data scientists sometimes struggle to combine data from multiple sources. The issue lies in the fact that data might be collected differently in each source, making it difficult to merge them into a single dataset while still making sure it's all accurate and consistent. Depending on the problem, it can be challenging for data scientists to clearly define the question they need to answer through data. Let's say a retail company is struggling with customer retention. In that case, they must transform the question, 'Why are customers leaving?' into a specific, data-driven problem that can be analyzed and addressed. There also tends to be bias in data when certain groups or factors are underrepresented or when the data reflects historical inequalities or prejudices. The challenge is actually noticing these biases and finding suitable ways to mitigate them to ensure fair, responsible decision-making. If not addressed, biased data can lead to skewed results and unfair outcomes, which can harm individuals or groups. The Future of Data Science Data science is projected to have a promising future. The Bureau of Labor Statistics reports a 36% increase in employment for data scientists from 2023 to 2033. So, for all those interested in joining the field, data suggests it's a wise choice. If we focus on the field itself, there are many exciting developments already emerging and expected to continue and be a part of the future. Technologies like deep learning, natural language processing (NLP), and quantum computing hold great potential and are expected to continue advancing, opening up new possibilities for data scientists. Additionally, there is growing recognition of the importance of ethical considerations in data science. With the increasing reliance on AI and data-driven decisions, matters of data privacy, fairness, and bias will come to the front. So, the demand for responsible AI practices and frameworks to guide ethical decision-making in data science is also expected to increase. As data science continues to grow, new challenges and opportunities will undoubtedly arise. Therefore, it's best to stay engaged and informed about any changes and advancements made in the field.

These skills are in high demand, and as a result, many individuals that are breaking into a data science career, explore a variety of data science programs, such as certification programs, data science courses, and degree programs offered by educational institutions. Data scientists are not necessarily directly responsible for all the processes involved in the data science lifecycle. For example, data pipelines are typically handled by data engineers, but the data scientist may make recommendations about what sort of data is useful or required. While data scientists can build machine learning models, scaling these efforts at a larger level requires more software engineering skills to optimize a program to run more quickly. As a result, it’s common for a data scientist to partner with machine learning engineers to scale machine learning models. Data scientist responsibilities can commonly overlap with a data analyst, particularly with exploratory data analysis and data visualization. However, a data scientist’s skillset is typically broader than the average data analyst. Comparatively speaking, data scientist leverage common programming languages, such as R and Python, to conduct more statistical inference and data visualization.

Watch all episodes of Mixture of Experts Data science versus business intelligence It may be easy to confuse the terms “data science” and “business intelligence” (BI) because they both relate to an organization’s data and analysis of that data, but they do differ in focus. Business intelligence (BI) is typically an umbrella term for the technology that enables data preparation, data mining, data management, and data visualization. Business intelligence tools and processes allow end users to identify actionable information from raw data, facilitating data-driven decision-making within organizations across various industries. While data science tools overlap in much of this regard, business intelligence focuses more on data from the past, and the insights from BI tools are more descriptive in nature. It uses data to understand what happened before to inform a course of action. BI is geared toward static (unchanging) data that is usually structured. While data science uses descriptive data, it typically utilizes it to determine predictive variables, which are then used to categorize data or to make forecasts. Data science and BI are not mutually exclusive, digitally savvy organizations use both to fully understand and extract value from their data. Data science tools Data scientists rely on popular programming languages to conduct exploratory data analysis and statistical regression. These open source tools support pre-built statistical modeling, machine learning, and graphics capabilities. These languages include the following (read more at \" Python vs. R: What's the Difference? \"): R Studio: An open source programming language and environment for developing statistical computing and graphics. Python: It is a dynamic and flexible programming language. The Python includes numerous libraries, such as NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, for analyzing data quickly. To facilitate sharing code and other information, data scientists may use GitHub and Jupyter notebooks. Some data scientists may prefer a user interface, and two common enterprise tools for statistical analysis include: SAS: A comprehensive tool suite, including visualizations and interactive dashboards, for analyzing, reporting, data mining, and predictive modeling. IBM SPSS : Offers advanced statistical analysis, a large library of machine learning algorithms, text analysis, open source extensibility, integration with big data, and seamless deployment into applications. Data scientists also gain proficiency in using big data processing platforms, such as Apache Spark, the open source framework Apache Hadoop, and NoSQL databases. They are also skilled with a wide range of data visualization tools, including simple graphics tools included with business presentation and spreadsheet applications (like Microsoft Excel), built-for-purpose commercial visualization tools like Tableau and IBM Cognos, and open source tools like D3.js (a JavaScript library for creating interactive data visualizations) and RAW Graphs. For building machine learning models, data scientists frequently turn to several frameworks like PyTorch, TensorFlow, MXNet, and Spark MLib. Given the steep learning curve in data science, many companies are seeking to accelerate their return on investment for AI projects; they often struggle to hire the talent needed to realize data science project’s full potential. To address this gap, they are turning to multipersona data science and machine learning (DSML) platforms, giving rise to the role of “citizen data scientist.” Multipersona DSML platforms use automation, self-service portals, and low-code/no-code user interfaces so that people with little or no background in digital technology or expert data science can create business value using data science and machine learning. These platforms also support expert data scientists by also offering a more technical interface. Using a multipersona DSML platform encourages collaboration across the enterprise. Data science and cloud computing Cloud computing scales data science by providing access to additional processing power, storage, and other tools required for data science projects. Since data science frequently leverages large data sets, tools that can scale with the size of the data is incredibly important, particularly for time-sensitive projects. Cloud storage solutions, such as data lakes, provide access to storage infrastructure, which are capable of ingesting and processing large volumes of data with ease. These storage systems provide flexibility to end users, allowing them to spin up large clusters as needed. They can also add incremental compute nodes to expedite data processing jobs, allowing the business to make short-term tradeoffs for a larger long-term outcome. Cloud platforms typically have different pricing models, such a per-use or subscriptions, to meet the needs of their end user, whether they are a large enterprise or a small startup. Open source technologies are widely used in data science tool sets. When they’re hosted in the cloud, teams don’t need to install, configure, maintain, or update them locally. Several cloud providers, including IBM Cloud®, also offer prepackaged tool kits that enable data scientists to build models without coding, further democratizing access to technology innovations and data insights. Data science use cases Enterprises can unlock numerous benefits from data science. Common use cases include process optimization through intelligent automation and enhanced targeting and personalization to improve the customer experience (CX). However, more specific examples include: Here are a few representative use cases for data science and artificial intelligence: An international bank delivers faster loan services with a mobile app using machine learning-powered credit risk models and a hybrid cloud computing architecture that is both powerful and secure. An electronics firm is developing ultra-powerful 3D-printed sensors to guide tomorrow’s driverless vehicles. The solution relies on data science and analytics tools to enhance its real-time object detection capabilities. A robotic process automation (RPA) solution provider developed a cognitive business process mining solution that reduces incident handling times between 15% and 95% for its client companies. The solution is trained to understand the content and sentiment of customer emails, directing service teams to prioritize those that are most relevant and urgent. A digital media technology company created an audience analytics platform that enables its clients to see what’s engaging TV audiences as they’re offered a growing range of digital channels. The solution employs deep analytics and machine learning to gather real-time insights into viewer behavior. An urban police department created statistical incident analysis tools to help officers understand when and where to deploy resources in order to prevent crime. The data-driven solution creates reports and dashboards to augment situational awareness for field officers.

Challenges in Data Science The Future of Data Science Data Science at Harvard SEAS What Is Data Science? A Complete Overview Have you noticed how, during election season, predictions about poll results and candidate leads dominate the news feed? They aren't baseless guesses; they're insights from public opinion surveys, voter turnout models, and a variety of advanced tools and methodologies used in data science. So, even if you've never worked with algorithms or predictive models, you're guaranteed to have encountered data science in your daily life—think of every time you've checked election forecasts, seen personalized ads, or simply browsed curated movie recommendations. That is data science, and it's all around us! Definition and purpose of data science The U.S. Census Bureau defines data science as \"a field of study that uses scientific methods, processes, and systems to extract knowledge and insights from data.\" So, this is a field that works with data that doesn't fit neatly into rows and columns—and, in the end, derives relevant information from it. Data science is inherently interdisciplinary as it combines expertise from statistics, computer science, mathematics, and domain-specific knowledge. This makes it incredibly versatile, with applications spanning healthcare, finance, marketing, and even environmental research. For instance, a data scientist in public health can analyze demographic data in order to make predictions about the spread of a disease. Similarly, in the business sector, data science guides personalized marketing strategies by working with data related to customer behavior. Nowadays, there is an overwhelming amount of data generated—millions of terabytes every day. It's often produced through everyday activities like scrolling through social media or buying something online. Each action leaves behind bits of information, like breadcrumbs, that systems gather and hold onto. But here's the thing: all this information doesn't come neatly organized and ready to work with. At first, it's just a chaotic mix of numbers, texts, and signals that need to be sorted and shaped into something meaningful before it's actually useful. Therefore, the purpose of data science is to work with some of that data and drive better-informed decision-making. History of data science Data science is often considered the intersection between statistics and computer science because its history is rooted in these two fields, and they share many of the same principles. In 1974, Peter Naur, a computer science pioneer, introduced the term \"data science\" in his book \"Concise Survey of Computer Methods\" as an alternative to \"computer science.\" Whereas in 1997, Jeff Wu called for statistics to be renamed data science and statisticians to data scientists. So, it was the convergence of statistics and computer science, coupled with technological advances, that paved the way for modern data science. However, when discussing the history of data science, many start with mathematical statistician John W. Tukey's \"The Future of Data Analysis.\" This 1962 paper signaled a call for a reformation of academic statistics, as Tukey argued that what he referred to then as data analysis was more than just mathematics. According to him, it was an empirical science, focusing on deriving meaning from data rather than just theoretical modeling. This perspective set the foundation for what would later become known as data science​. Later, in 1977, the International Association for Statistical Computing (IASC) was created. Their mission statement was \"to link traditional statistical methodology, modern computer technology, and the knowledge of domain experts in order to convert data into information and knowledge.\" Around the same time, advancements in data visualization and exploratory data analysis, particularly with Tukey's publication of \"Exploratory Data Analysis,\" further brought to light the importance of using data for hypothesis generation and testing​. The field continued to grow, and by the late 1990s, the term \"data science\" had gained broader recognition​. In 2001, American computer scientist and professor William S. Cleveland outlined a broader vision for statistics that shifted from the traditional theoretical one to a more applied, data-centric focus​. This way, a new field would emerge that integrated elements of machine learning, visualization, and computing. The emergence of big data in the early 21st century truly cemented data science as the discipline for working with and making sense of complex, large-scale information, ultimately becoming what many consider the \" fourth paradigm \" of scientific discovery, following experimental, theoretical, and computational science. The Data Science Life Cycle We're all familiar with life cycles—whether it's the natural stages of growth in living beings or the progression of a product from creation to completion. They're processes that start with one form, go through several phases of development or change, and eventually reach an endpoint or transformation. In the same way, data science has its own life cycle. The data science life cycle represents the systematic process data goes through to be transformed into meaningful insights. Like all other life cycles, it's a structured cycle in which each phase builds on the last to reach the final results. Step-by-step process in data science The data science life cycle encompasses five key steps that data must go through in order to provide valuable insights. These steps are: Obtaining data The first step in the data science life cycle is obtaining the data. Data scientists can collect data from a variety of sources, including databases, sensors, APIs (application programming interfaces), and online platforms. At this stage, the most important thing is ensuring that you have the right information to work with. So, you should gather data that is relevant to the problem you're trying to solve to avoid wasting time and effort with all the other steps that follow. Cleaning data After the data is collected, data scientists clean and preprocess it. This step, often referred to as data cleaning or wrangling, requires data scientists to format the data for analysis and deal with missing values, duplicates, and other errors. Data scientists spend a significant portion of the cycle at this stage, as cleaning and preparing the data guarantees that it will be both usable and reliable—key prerequisites for achieving good results. Exploring data At this stage, the data is ready, so data scientists begin the so-called exploratory data analysis (EDA) process. The aim is to understand the data's underlying structures and main characteristics and identify patterns. Depending on the number of variables analyzed at a time, EDA can utilize univariate, bivariate, or multivariate analysis. The goal is to better understand the data and develop hypotheses to guide model building or further analyses. Modeling data Next, data scientists use machine learning algorithms or different statistical techniques in order to predict outcomes or explain relationships within the data. Depending on the problem, these models can be predictive, such as forecasting future sales, or descriptive, such as clustering customers by behavior. Interpreting results If all previous steps are done correctly, data scientists should have produced results by the end of the cycle, and all that is left to do is interpret the conclusions and communicate them to the rest of the team. Communication plays a huge role at this stage, as all insights should be presented in a clear and concise manner so that stakeholders can understand them and be able to use them to aid decision-making. Data Science Tools and Technologies Data scientists have an array of tools and technologies to tackle various challenges. The choice of tools often depends on the type of data, the problem to solve, and the stage of the data science life cycle. Tools used in data science: Python and R Python and R are foundational programming languages in data science. Python is valued for its simplicity, versatility, and extensive libraries for data manipulation, machine learning, and visualization. R excels in statistical analysis and creating high-quality visualizations, making it ideal for research and exploratory analysis. SQL SQL (Structured Query Language) is essential for working with databases. It allows data scientists to query, retrieve, and manipulate structured data efficiently, making it a cornerstone for organizing and analyzing data. Big data technologies Technologies like Apache Spark and Databricks enable distributed processing and analysis of massive datasets. Cloud platforms such as AWS, Google Cloud, and Azure amplify these capabilities with scalable infrastructure and tools tailored for modern big data and machine learning workflows. Data visualization tools Visualization is essential for exploring data and presenting findings. Data scientists often rely on Python libraries like Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly, as well as R's ggplot2, for creating high-quality and customizable visualizations. For building interactive dashboards and sharing insights with non-technical stakeholders, tools like Tableau are popular and widely used. Machine learning platforms Frameworks such as TensorFlow, scikit-learn, and PyTorch streamline the development of machine learning models. From linear regression to deep neural networks, these platforms provide the tools to extract insights, automate processes, and make predictions. Learn about Harvard's Data Science Masters program Core Techniques in Data Science Depending on the focus and aim, the four core techniques of analysis used in data science are: Descriptive analysis This kind of analysis focuses on summarizing and describing a dataset's main features through averages, percentages, and frequencies. An example would be a retail company analyzing customer data to determine the average spending per customer. Diagnostic analysis Data scientists working in hospitals could use diagnostic analysis to investigate data and find out factors that lead to higher patient readmission rates in a specific department. The goal is to understand the causes of certain outcomes or trends. Predictive analysis By applying statistical models like regression or classification algorithms, data scientists can predict what is likely to happen in the future. For example, a company might use predictive analysis to estimate future sales or anticipate customer behavior based on past data patterns. Prescriptive analysis Prescriptive analysis goes a step beyond prediction by recommending actions based on data insights. This type of analysis helps businesses make decisions about resource allocation, strategic planning, or personalized customer recommendations. Career Opportunities in Data Science The skills and knowledge gained in data science are highly transferable. Therefore, with an education and experience in this field, professionals can pursue various careers in data science, including but not limited to the following: Data analyst Data analysts focus on interpreting and reporting historical data. Their primary responsibility is analyzing trends and patterns to produce insights that inform business decisions. They work with structured datasets, create visualizations, and generate reports that help stakeholders understand what has happened and why. Data scientist Building on the work of data analysts, data scientists go a step further by applying advanced analytical models and machine learning techniques to predict future trends and solve complex problems. They work with both structured and unstructured data, and their role often involves formulating hypotheses, designing experiments, and creating predictive models. Data scientists bridge the gap between interpreting historical data and generating forward-looking insights. Machine learning engineer Machine learning engineers specialize in operationalizing the models developed by data scientists. While data scientists focus on research and experimentation, machine learning engineers design, build, and deploy scalable systems that integrate machine learning algorithms into production environments. They also optimize model performance, manage large-scale datasets, and ensure the systems are reliable and efficient. Data engineer Data engineers provide the foundational infrastructure that supports the entire data life cycle. They design and manage data pipelines, ensure data quality, and integrate data from various sources. Their work enables data analysts, data scientists, and machine learning engineers to access reliable, high-quality data for their tasks. Data engineers are the architects of the data ecosystem, ensuring that data flows seamlessly and is accessible for analysis and modeling. Applications of Data Science Across Industries When we think of people working with data, the tech sector is often the first that comes to mind. However, while the tech industry is certainly a major hub for data scientists, the truth is that data science applications extend to a wide variety of industries. Data science in healthcare Metrics like temperature, heart rate, and brain activity are more easily analyzed when using data science methods. Therefore, data science can be applied in the healthcare industry to monitor patient health, predict outcomes, personalize treatments, and detect anomalies. Data science in finance Data science also makes a big difference in finance, particularly through insights into customer behaviors. For example, algorithms spot unusual patterns in transactions, thus flagging potential fraudulent activities. Many companies also use data science services in finance for algorithmic trading and risk analytics detection. Data science in environmental science Recently, data science has also become a powerful ally in environmental science. The insights extracted from data help experts deal with climate change modeling, resource management, and biodiversity tracking, among other things. Harvard's SEAS Environmental Science and Engineering program is an excellent degree option that teaches students about the interdisciplinary perspective needed to solve various environmental challenges. Data Science vs. Related Fields Data science often intersects with and complements other related fields. However, there are usually key differences between each field, defining their roles. Understanding these differences will help further clarify the all-important questions of \"What is data science?\" and \"What do data scientists do?\" Data science vs. data analytics Data science and data analytics both involve working with data, and the distinction between the two is so unclear that they are often used interchangeably. However, the latter is generally seen as a subset of data science since while data science deals with more complex techniques to analyze datasets to make future predictions and automate processes, data analytics tends to focus on interpreting and visualizing the data. Data science vs. machine learning Machine learning focuses on creating algorithms to learn from data without explicit programming and make predictions, which is crucial for data science. However, data science encompasses a broader range of techniques for extracting information from data, including machine learning algorithms, data wrangling, statistical analysis, and more. Data science vs. data engineering Data science and engineering also work with data, but they usually operate at different stages of the data process. While data engineers build the infrastructure for handling data, data scientists are focused on using that data in order to gain insights and use them for decision-making. Data science vs. statistics As seen when examining the field's history, statistics was the foundation of data science. However, while statistics focuses on understanding and explaining data, data science takes it a few steps further by using algorithms and computational tools to automate analysis, make predictions, and generate actionable insights. So, although data science often applies statistical concepts, it also involves machine learning, programming, and domain expertise. Learn about the Master's in Data Science at Harvard Why Is Data Science Important? Data science is invaluable in helping businesses and industries make better-informed choices. If a retailer uses data science to gain insights into customer purchasing patterns and adjusts inventory levels based on the results, then they can avoid overstocking or understocking. There are also instances when data science helps uncover patterns and trends that can inspire new products, services, or business strategies. Think of streaming platforms like Netflix—by analyzing their viewer data they can recommend personalized content, as well as have ideas about the creation of original programming that appeals to specific audiences. By identifying such trends, companies innovate and reduce costs by focusing on what truly adds value to their customers, whether that be optimizing supply chains or personalizing marketing efforts to increase conversions. Challenges in Data Science As we've established, data science brings many advantages to various industries. However, there is no rose without thorns, so to reap the benefits of data science, you must, from time to time, also deal with certain challenges. For example, data scientists sometimes struggle to combine data from multiple sources. The issue lies in the fact that data might be collected differently in each source, making it difficult to merge them into a single dataset while still making sure it's all accurate and consistent. Depending on the problem, it can be challenging for data scientists to clearly define the question they need to answer through data. Let's say a retail company is struggling with customer retention. In that case, they must transform the question, 'Why are customers leaving?' into a specific, data-driven problem that can be analyzed and addressed. There also tends to be bias in data when certain groups or factors are underrepresented or when the data reflects historical inequalities or prejudices. The challenge is actually noticing these biases and finding suitable ways to mitigate them to ensure fair, responsible decision-making. If not addressed, biased data can lead to skewed results and unfair outcomes, which can harm individuals or groups. The Future of Data Science Data science is projected to have a promising future. The Bureau of Labor Statistics reports a 36% increase in employment for data scientists from 2023 to 2033. So, for all those interested in joining the field, data suggests it's a wise choice. If we focus on the field itself, there are many exciting developments already emerging and expected to continue and be a part of the future. Technologies like deep learning, natural language processing (NLP), and quantum computing hold great potential and are expected to continue advancing, opening up new possibilities for data scientists. Additionally, there is growing recognition of the importance of ethical considerations in data science. With the increasing reliance on AI and data-driven decisions, matters of data privacy, fairness, and bias will come to the front. So, the demand for responsible AI practices and frameworks to guide ethical decision-making in data science is also expected to increase. As data science continues to grow, new challenges and opportunities will undoubtedly arise. Therefore, it's best to stay engaged and informed about any changes and advancements made in the field.

How to become a data scientist? What is data science? Data science is the study of data to extract meaningful insights for business. It is a multidisciplinary approach that combines principles and practices from the fields of mathematics, statistics, artificial intelligence, and computer engineering to analyze large amounts of data. This analysis helps data scientists to ask and answer questions like what happened, why it happened, what will happen, and what can be done with the results. Why is data science important? Data science is important because it combines tools, methods, and technology to generate meaning from data. Modern organizations are inundated with data; there is a proliferation of devices that can automatically collect and store information. Online systems and payment portals capture more data in the fields of e-commerce, medicine, finance, and every other aspect of human life. We have text, audio, video, and image data available in vast quantities. History of data science While the term data science is not new, the meanings and connotations have changed over time. The word first appeared in the ’60s as an alternative name for statistics. In the late ’90s, computer science professionals formalized the term. A proposed definition for data science saw it as a separate field with three aspects: data design, collection, and analysis. It still took another decade for the term to be used outside of academia. Future of data science Artificial intelligence and machine learning innovations have made data processing faster and more efficient. Industry demand has created an ecosystem of courses, degrees, and job positions within the field of data science. Because of the cross-functional skillset and expertise required, data science shows strong projected growth over the coming decades. What is data science used for? Data science is used to study data in four main ways: 1. Descriptive analysis Descriptive analysis examines data to gain insights into what happened or what is happening in the data environment. It is characterized by data visualizations such as pie charts, bar charts, line graphs, tables, or generated narratives. For example, a flight booking service may record data like the number of tickets booked each day. Descriptive analysis will reveal booking spikes, booking slumps, and high-performing months for this service. 2. Diagnostic analysis Diagnostic analysis is a deep-dive or detailed data examination to understand why something happened. It is characterized by techniques such as drill-down, data discovery, data mining, and correlations. Multiple data operations and transformations may be performed on a given data set to discover unique patterns in each of these techniques.For example, the flight service might drill down on a particularly high-performing month to better understand the booking spike. This may lead to the discovery that many customers visit a particular city to attend a monthly sporting event. 3. Predictive analysis Predictive analysis uses historical data to make accurate forecasts about data patterns that may occur in the future. It is characterized by techniques such as machine learning, forecasting, pattern matching, and predictive modeling. In each of these techniques, computers are trained to reverse engineer causality connections in the data.For example, the flight service team might use data science to predict flight booking patterns for the coming year at the start of each year. The computer program or algorithm may look at past data and predict booking spikes for certain destinations in May. Having anticipated their customer’s future travel requirements, the company could start targeted advertising for those cities from February. 4. Prescriptive analysis Prescriptive analytics takes predictive data to the next level. It not only predicts what is likely to happen but also suggests an optimum response to that outcome. It can analyze the potential implications of different choices and recommend the best course of action. It uses graph analysis, simulation, complex event processing, neural networks, and recommendation engines from machine learning. Back to the flight booking example, prescriptive analysis could look at historical marketing campaigns to maximize the advantage of the upcoming booking spike. A data scientist could project booking outcomes for different levels of marketing spend on various marketing channels. These data forecasts would give the flight booking company greater confidence in their marketing decisions. What are the benefits of data science for business? Data science is revolutionizing the way companies operate. Many businesses, regardless of size, need a robust data science strategy to drive growth and maintain a competitive edge. Some key benefits include: Discover unknown transformative patterns Data science allows businesses to uncover new patterns and relationships that have the potential to transform the organization. It can reveal low-cost changes to resource management for maximum impact on profit margins.For example, an e-commerce company uses data science to discover that too many customer queries are being generated after business hours. Investigations reveal that customers are more likely to purchase if they receive a prompt response instead of an answer the next business day. By implementing 24/7 customer service, the business grows its revenue by 30%. Innovate new products and solutions Data science can reveal gaps and problems that would otherwise go unnoticed. Greater insight about purchase decisions, customer feedback, and business processes can drive innovation in internal operations and external solutions.For example, an online payment solution uses data science to collate and analyze customer comments about the company on social media. Analysis reveals that customers forget passwords during peak purchase periods and are unhappy with the current password retrieval system. The company can innovate a better solution and see a significant increase in customer satisfaction. Real-time optimization It’s very challenging for businesses, especially large-scale enterprises, to respond to changing conditions in real-time. This can cause significant losses or disruptions in business activity. Data science can help companies predict change and react optimally to different circumstances.For example, a truck-based shipping company uses data science to reduce downtime when trucks break down. They identify the routes and shift patterns that lead to faster breakdowns and tweak truck schedules. They also set up an inventory of common spare parts that need frequent replacement so trucks can be repaired faster. What is the data science process? A business problem typically initiates the data science process. A data scientist will work with business stakeholders to understand what business needs. Once the problem has been defined, the data scientist may solve it using the OSEMN data science process: O – Obtain data Data can be pre-existing, newly acquired, or a data repository downloadable from the internet. Data scientists can extract data from internal or external databases, company CRM software, web server logs, social media or purchase it from trusted third-party sources. S – Scrub data Data scrubbing, or data cleaning, is the process of standardizing the data according to a predetermined format. It includes handling missing data, fixing data errors, and removing any data outliers. Some examples of data scrubbing are:· Changing all date values to a common standard format.· Fixing spelling mistakes or additional spaces.· Fixing mathematical inaccuracies or removing commas from large numbers. E – Explore data Data exploration is preliminary data analysis that is used for planning further data modeling strategies. Data scientists gain an initial understanding of the data using descriptive statistics and data visualization tools. Then they explore the data to identify interesting patterns that can be studied or actioned. M – Model data Software and machine learning algorithms are used to gain deeper insights, predict outcomes, and prescribe the best course of action. Machine learning techniques like association, classification, and clustering are applied to the training data set. The model might be tested against predetermined test data to assess result accuracy. The data model can be fine-tuned many times to improve result outcomes. N – Interpret results Data scientists work together with analysts and businesses to convert data insights into action. They make diagrams, graphs, and charts to represent trends and predictions. Data summarization helps stakeholders understand and implement results effectively. What are the data science techniques? Data science professionals use computing systems to follow the data science process. The top techniques used by data scientists are: Classification Classification is the sorting of data into specific groups or categories. Computers are trained to identify and sort data. Known data sets are used to build decision algorithms in a computer that quickly processes and categorizes the data. For example:· Sort products as popular or not popular· Sort insurance applications as high risk or low risk· Sort social media comments into positive, negative, or neutral. Data science professionals use computing systems to follow the data science process. Regression Regression is the method of finding a relationship between two seemingly unrelated data points. The connection is usually modeled around a mathematical formula and represented as a graph or curves. When the value of one data point is known, regression is used to predict the other data point. For example:· The rate of spread of air-borne diseases.· The relationship between customer satisfaction and the number of employees.· The relationship between the number of fire stations and the number of injuries due to fire in a particular location. Clustering Clustering is the method of grouping closely related data together to look for patterns and anomalies. Clustering is different from sorting because the data cannot be accurately classified into fixed categories. Hence the data is grouped into most likely relationships. New patterns and relationships can be discovered with clustering. For example: · Group customers with similar purchase behavior for improved customer service.· Group network traffic to identify daily usage patterns and identify a network attack faster. Cluster articles into multiple different news categories and use this information to find fake news content. The basic principle behind data science techniques While the details vary, the underlying principles behind these techniques are: Teach a machine how to sort data based on a known data set. For example, sample keywords are given to the computer with their sort value. “Happy” is positive, while “Hate” is negative. Give unknown data to the machine and allow the device to sort the dataset independently. Allow for result inaccuracies and handle the probability factor of the result. What are different data science technologies? Data science practitioners work with complex technologies such as: Artificial intelligence: Machine learning models and related software are used for predictive and prescriptive analysis. Cloud computing: Cloud technologies have given data scientists the flexibility and processing power required for advanced data analytics. Internet of things: IoT refers to various devices that can automatically connect to the internet. These devices collect data for data science initiatives. They generate massive data which can be used for data mining and data extraction. Quantum computing: Quantum computers can perform complex calculations at high speed. Skilled data scientists use them for building complex quantitative algorithms. How does data science compare to other related data fields? Data science is an all-encompassing term for other data-related roles and fields. Let’s look at some of them here: What is the difference between data science and data analytics? While the terms may be used interchangeably, data analytics is a subset of data science. Data science is an umbrella term for all aspects of data processing—from the collection to modeling to insights. On the other hand, data analytics is mainly concerned with statistics, mathematics, and statistical analysis. It focuses on only data analysis, while data science is related to the bigger picture around organizational data.In most workplaces, data scientists and data analysts work together towards common business goals. A data analyst may spend more time on routine analysis, providing regular reports. A data scientist may design the way data is stored, manipulated, and analyzed. Simply put, a data analyst makes sense out of existing data, whereas a data scientist creates new methods and tools to process data for use by analysts. What is the difference between data science and business analytics? While there is an overlap between data science and business analytics, the key difference is the use of technology in each field. Data scientists work more closely with data technology than business analysts.Business analysts bridge the gap between business and IT. They define business cases, collect information from stakeholders, or validate solutions. Data scientists, on the other hand, use technology to work with business data. They may write programs, apply machine learning techniques to create models, and develop new algorithms. Data scientists not only understand the problem but can also build a tool that provides solutions to the problem.It’s not unusual to find business analysts and data scientists working on the same team. Business analysts take the output from data scientists and use it to tell a story that the broader business can understand. What is the difference between data science and data engineering? Data engineers build and maintain the systems that allow data scientists to access and interpret data. They work more closely with underlying technology than a data scientist. The role generally involves creating data models, building data pipelines, and overseeing extract, transform, load (ETL). Depending on organization setup and size, the data engineer may also manage related infrastructure like big-data storage, streaming, and processing platforms like Amazon S3.Data scientists use the data that data engineers have processed to build and train predictive models. Data scientists may then hand over the results to the analysts for further decision making. What is the difference between data science and machine learning? learning?Machine learning is the science of training machines to analyze and learn from data the way humans do. It is one of the methods used in data science projects to gain automated insights from data. Machine learning engineers specialize in computing, algorithms, and coding skills specific to machine learning methods. Data scientists might use machine learning methods as a tool or work closely with other machine learning engineers to process data. What is the difference between data science and statistics? Statistics is a mathematically-based field that seeks to collect and interpret quantitative data. In contrast, data science is a multidisciplinary field that uses scientific methods, processes, and systems to extract knowledge from data in various forms. Data scientists use methods from many disciplines, including statistics. However, the fields differ in their processes and the problems they study. What are different data science tools? AWS has a range of tools to support data scientists around the globe: Data storage For data warehousing, Amazon Redshift can run complex queries against structured or unstructured data. Analysts and data scientists can use AWS Glue to manage and search for data. AWS Glue automatically creates a unified catalog of all data in the data lake, with metadata attached to make it discoverable. Machine learning Amazon SageMaker is a fully-managed machine learning service that runs on the Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2). It allows users to organize data, build, train and deploy machine learning models, and scale operations. Analytics Amazon Athena is an interactive query service that makes it easy to analyze data in Amazon S3 or Glacier . It is fast, serverless, and works using standard SQL queries. Amazon Elastic MapReduce (EMR) processes big data using servers like Spark and Hadoop. Amazon Kinesis allows aggregation and processing of streaming data in real-time. It uses website clickstreams, application logs, and telemetry data from IoT devices. Amazon OpenSearch allows search, analysis, and visualization of petabytes of data. What does a data scientist do? A data scientist can use a range of different techniques, tools, and technologies as part of the data science process. Based on the problem, they pick the best combinations for faster and more accurate results. A data scientist’s role and day-to-day work vary depending on the size and requirements of the organization. While they typically follow the data science process, the details may vary. In larger data science teams, a data scientist may work with other analysts, engineers, machine learning experts, and statisticians to ensure the data science process is followed end-to-end and business goals are achieved. However, in smaller teams, a data scientist may wear several hats. Based on experience, skills, and educational background, they may perform multiple roles or overlapping roles. In this case, their daily responsibilities might include engineering, analysis, and machine learning along with core data science methodologies. What are the challenges faced by data scientists? Multiple data sources Different types of apps and tools generate data in various formats. Data scientists have to clean and prepare data to make it consistent. This can be tedious and time-consuming. Understanding the business problem Data scientists have to work with multiple stakeholders and business managers to define the problem to be solved. This can be challenging—especially in large companies with multiple teams that have varying requirements. Elimination of bias Machine learning tools are not completely accurate, and some uncertainty or bias can exist as a result. Biases are imbalances in the training data or prediction behavior of the model across different groups, such as age or income bracket. For instance, if the tool is trained primarily on data from middle-aged individuals, it may be less accurate when making predictions involving younger and older people. The field of machine learning provides an opportunity to address biases by detecting them and measuring them in the data and model. How to become a data scientist? There are usually three steps to becoming a data scientist: Earn a bachelor's degree in IT, computer science, math, physics, or another related field.

What is Data Science? Data Science is about data gathering, analysis and decision-making. Data Science is about finding patterns in data, through analysis, and make \nfuture predictions. By using Data Science, companies are able to make: Better decisions (should we choose A or B) Predictive analysis (what will happen next?) Pattern discoveries (find pattern, or maybe hidden information in the \n  data) Where is Data Science Needed? Data Science is used in many industries \nin the world today, e.g. banking, consultancy, healthcare, and manufacturing. Examples of where Data Science is needed: For route planning: To discover the best routes to ship To foresee delays for flight/ship/train etc. (through predictive \n    analysis) To create promotional offers To find the best suited time to deliver goods To forecast the next years revenue for a company To analyze health benefit of training To predict who will win elections Data Science can be applied in nearly every part of a business where data is available. Examples are: Consumer goods Stock markets Industry Politics Logistic companies E-commerce How Does a Data Scientist Work? A Data Scientist requires expertise in several \nbackgrounds: Machine Learning Statistics Programming (Python or R) Mathematics Databases A Data Scientist must find patterns within the data. Before he/she can find \nthe patterns, he/she must organize the data in a standard format. Here is how a Data Scientist works: Ask the right questions - To understand the business \n  problem. Explore and collect data - From database, web logs, \n  customer feedback, etc. Extract the data - Transform the data to a standardized \nformat. Clean the data - Remove erroneous values from the data. Find and replace missing values - Check for \nmissing values and replace them with a suitable value (e.g. an average value). Normalize data - Scale the values in a practical range \n  (e.g. 140 cm is smaller than 1,8 m. However, the number 140 \nis larger than 1,8. - so scaling is important). Analyze data, find patterns and make future predictions . Represent the result - Present the result with useful \n  insights in a way the \"company\" can understand. Where to Start? In this tutorial, we will start by presenting what data is and how data can be analyzed. You will learn how to use statistics and mathematical functions to make \npredictions. ❮ Previous Next ❯ ★ +1 Sign in to track progress COLOR PICKER REMOVE ADS PLUS SPACES GET CERTIFIED FOR TEACHERS FOR BUSINESS CONTACT US × Contact Sales If you want to use W3Schools services as an educational institution, team or enterprise, send us an e-mail: sales@w3schools.com Report Error If you want to report an error, or if you want to make a suggestion, send us an e-mail: help@w3schools.com Top Tutorials HTML Tutorial CSS Tutorial JavaScript Tutorial How To Tutorial SQL Tutorial Python Tutorial W3.CSS Tutorial Bootstrap Tutorial PHP Tutorial Java Tutorial C++ Tutorial jQuery Tutorial Top References HTML Reference CSS Reference JavaScript Reference SQL Reference Python Reference W3.CSS Reference Bootstrap Reference PHP Reference HTML Colors Java Reference AngularJS Reference jQuery Reference Top Examples HTML Examples CSS Examples JavaScript Examples How To Examples SQL Examples Python Examples W3.CSS Examples Bootstrap Examples PHP Examples Java Examples XML Examples jQuery Examples Get Certified HTML Certificate CSS Certificate JavaScript Certificate Front End Certificate SQL Certificate Python Certificate PHP Certificate jQuery Certificate Java Certificate C++ Certificate C# Certificate XML Certificate     FORUM ABOUT ACADEMY W3Schools is optimized for learning and training.

Many temples The Meenakshi Temple in Madurai India is crawling with religious temples and monuments, which are visited by locals and foreigners from all over the world. Some of the most famous temples in India are the Meenakshi Temple in Madurai , the Golden Temple in Amritsar , the Virupaksha Temple in Hampi, the Brihadeeshvara Temple in Thanjavur, the Kashi Vishwanath Temple in Varanasi and the Monkey Temple in Jaipur . I’m only naming a fraction here, as it would be impossible to name them all. It’s estimated that there are around 2 million temples in India, and the number is still growing every year. You will find plenty of Hindu Kovils, Buddhist temples, Jain temples, Sikh temples, Churches and Mosques all over the country. 2. Bollywood Bollywood street art in Mumbai Bollywood, a mixture of “Bombay” and “Hollywood”, is India’s Hindi-language film industry, which is based in Mumbai (previously known as Bombay ). This is the world’s largest film industry , producing three times more films than Hollywood. The Indian film industry originated in 1913, and it’s characterised by its song-and-dance scenes, melodrama and vibrant colours. Bollywood has produced many famous movies like Dangal, Salaam Bombay! and Chhichhore. 3. Famous monuments The Taj Mahal is one of the most famous monuments in India One of the things India is most known for is its abundance of famous historical monuments . The Taj Mahal is the most popular one, but there are many more! Mysore Palace , Maratha Palace , Hawa Mahal , Red Fort , Amer Fort and Humayun’s Tomb are just a few examples. One thing is certain: if you’re travelling around this country, there won’t be a shortage of impressive monuments to visit! 4. Many languages More than a whopping 19,500 languages or dialects are spoken as a mother tongue in India, and 121 of these languages are spoken by more than 10,000 people. That’s A LOT of languages if you’re asking me! The most spoken languages are Hindi (43.63%), Bengali (8.03%), Marathi (6.86%), Telugu (6.70%) and Tamil (5.70%). 5. Origin of Yoga The origin of yoga can be traced back to the north of India. Yoga focuses on bringing harmony between the mind and body while building strength and awareness. It’s said to have originated in India over 5,000 years ago, and the word “yoga” was first mentioned in the Rig Veda, the earliest of the four sacred books of Hinduism. This spiritual discipline is now known and practised almost all around the world, and it’s definitely one of the things India is most famous for. You will find plenty of yoga trainings in India , and many yoga lovers flock to this country to practice this discipline. 6. Largest postal network in the world The highest postal office in the world is in Hikkim With a network of 156,721 post offices, India has the largest postal network globally . Kashmir’s famous Dal Lake in Srinagar even has a two-century-old floating postal office , which is the only floating postal office in the world. And as if that wasn’t enough, the village of Hikkim, which is in Spiti Valley in the Indian Himalayas, is home to the world’s highest postal office ! This postal office stands at an altitude of 4,400 m (14,567 feet) above sea level. 🎁 Read: Best Gifts from India 7. Ayurvedic medicine Ingredients for Ayurvedic medicine One of the world’s oldest holistic medicines , Ayurveda, originated in India over 3,000 years ago.  Holistic medicine focuses on the whole body, including mental factors, instead of just the symptoms of a disease. This type of medicine seeks to treat the body, mind and spirit while preventing disease through diet and lifestyle regimens. Today, Ayurveda medicine is practised in many parts of the world. However, having its roots in India, this is where the best Ayurvedic treatments can be found. 8. Home of the Dalai Lama The Dalai Lama Temple in McLeodGanj As I’m writing this, I’m sitting in a little café in McLeodGanj (Dharamshala), which is where the Dalai Lama lives. I haven’t seen him in person, but if you’re lucky, you may actually catch a glimpse of him at his personal temple! But how did the Dalai Lama, the spiritual leader of Tibet, end up in India? After the failed Tibetan uprising of 1959, the 14th Dalai Lama feared for his life, and that’s when he fled to India . He first lived in Mussoorie for a year and then moved to McLeod Ganj, which is often called “Little Lhasa”. Tibetans in exile have been given asylum in India ever since. 9. Large population Crowds gather at a festival in Udaipur With over 1.5 billion people, India is the most populated country in the world . It actually surpassed China in 2023. India makes up for 1/6th of the population in the world! This country is also the largest democracy in the world, with around 912 million people eligible to vote. When you’re walking around the streets of cities like Delhi , it becomes clear how populated the country is. Approximately 18.6 million people are living in this city alone, which is more than the population of Belgium , my home country (I do admit Belgium is super small, but you get the picture). 10. Mehndi tattoos (henna) Mehndi originated in India at least 5,000 years ago It’s estimated that mehndi (or henna ) originated in the Indian subcontinent at least 5,000 years ago. Mehndi tattoos are temporary, and they’re made using a paste created with the powdered dry leaves of the henna plant. This form of body art is popular among women both in South Asia as well as in North Africa, where it’s called “henna”. In India, mehndi is traditionally applied on the hands and the feet during Hindu weddings, festivals and other celebrations. It’s believed to bring prosperity and good luck . 11. Mahatma Gandhi Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi, better known as Mahatma Gandhi (“Mahatma” means great soul), was an Indian lawyer and the primary leader of India’s independence movement. Gandhi led India to freedom from British colonial rule in 1947. Unfortunately, he was assassinated in Delhi just five months after India’s independence. Gandhi is known all around the world for his philosophy of non-violence and equality for all. ✍️ Read: Quotes About India to Inspire Your Trip 12. Ganges River Varanasi, located by the Ganges River Nearly 80% of the Ganges River is in India. You can find the rest in Nepal, China and Bangladesh . This river is the most sacred river to the Hindus , and it’s worshipped as the Goddess Ganga. The Ganges is believed to cleanse the sins of the faithful, and it’s also considered to be a gateway to heaven, so the ashes of the deceased are laid in this river. This river flows through several towns and cities, but most Hindus visit it in Varanasi, as this city is considered the holiest. 13. Diversity Of all the countries I have visited so far, India is definitely the most diverse. There’s a huge difference between the north and the south of India , for example. Not only is it a country with many different religions, languages and cultures, but the country’s landscapes also offer a lot of variation.  From the many beaches and waterfalls to the Himalayan mountains and the Great Indian Desert, India truly has it all! 14. Indian food Delicious food in Auroville Indian cuisine is one of the most well-known cuisines in the world. It’s known to be flavourful and sometimes spicy. From biryani and tikka masala to dosa , naan and paneer , Indian food is famous all across the world. The country is a real paradise for foodies! Perhaps the most famous Indian dish is curry, but there’s actually no such word in any of the many languages in India. The term “curry” was introduced by the British and refers to a dish prepared with spices from India. Some of my favourite Indian dishes are aloo jeera, matar paneer and sahi paneer. 15. Famous inventions We can thank India for many famous inventions. For example, Indians were the first people to use the number zero. They also invented the USB , wireless communication , yoga (#4 on this list), shampoo , buttons , chess and Snakes & Ladders . India also greatly contributed to the medical field. This is the country where Ayurvedic medicine (#8 on this list) originated, and we can thank the Indian physician Sushruta for developing cataract surgery . The latter was already developed in the 6th century BC. 16. Architecture The Ahar Cenotaphs in Udaipur With some of the world’s greatest architectural wonders like the Taj Mahal and the Lotus Temple, and the Instagrammable Patrika Gate , architecture is another thing India is famous for. India is one of the oldest civilisations in the world, and it has a great variety of architectural styles. Some of the most famous examples are the country’s Mughal architecture , Sikh architecture, temple architecture and cave architecture . 17. Highest population of vegetarians With 26% of the total population being vegetarian according to the World Animal Foundation , India is the country with the highest population of vegetarians worldwide. Vegetarianism became popular in India thanks to the introduction of Buddhism, Hinduism and Jainism. All three religions believe in the ethical principle of Ahimsa, which aims not to cause harm to other living things. India is a true paradise for vegetarians, as vegetarian food can easily be found everywhere here, and nearly every dish has a vegetarian version. 18. Colourful festivals Chithirai Festival in Madurai Being culturally rich, India is home to some of the world’s most spectacular festivals. The most famous ones are Holi – the festival of colours, and Diwali – the festival of lights. Both of these Indian festivals are held in Winter . But there are many, many more festivals in India – when I was exploring the South of the country in April, I accidentally found myself in the middle of a festival twice! One of these was Chithirai – an annual Tamil Hindu celebration in Madurai. It was a beautiful and very authentic experience to celebrate Chithirai with the locals, as this part of India is not very touristy. This being said, I don’t recommend visiting the South of India in April unless you can handle the scorching heat. I’ve honestly never been so hot in my life! 19. The Kama Sutra Khajuraho The Kama Sutra is an ancient Northern Indian Sanskrit text on erotic love . It was written somewhere around the 3rd century, but except for his name, nothing is known about its author, Vatsyayana Mallanga. Contrary to what many people think, the Kama Sutra is not just a sex manual. It’s also a guide on the nature of love, finding a life partner and maintaining one’s love life. 20. Colourful clothes (and colourful everything) Women wearing colourful clothes in Madurai One of the things I love the most about India is the beautiful colours that you see nearly everywhere. Traditional Indian ensembles feature bright colours like yellow, red, green, orange, purple, etc. Though mostly colourful, traditional clothes vary from one part of the country to another. Depending on where you’re going, you will see people wearing sarees, panches, shalwar kameez, langa and many more ensembles. But it’s not only the clothes that are colourful in India. You will also find colourful cities here, like Jodhpur – the blue city, Jaipur – the pink city and Pondicherry – the yellow city . 👚 Read: What to Wear in India: 5 Essential Tips + Outfit Ideas 21. Highest population of tigers India is known for being home to the highest population of tigers. According to the National Tiger Conservation Authority, there are 2,967 tigers in the country, which is 76% of all the tigers in the world . After a century of decline, the population of this endangered species is slowly going upward again, but there’s still much work needed to secure this beautiful animal’s future. 22. Tallest statue in the world The Statue of Unity, the tallest statue in the world With 182 m (597 ft), the Statue of Unity is the tallest in the world. This statue is located in the state of Gujarat on the western coast of India, and it was completed in 2018. The Statue of Unity is an ode to the Indian statesman Vallabhbhai Patel, who is also called the “Iron Man of India”. Patel was the first Deputy Prime Minister of India (1947 – 1950), and he played a big role in uniting the country. 23. North Sentinel Island North Sentinel Island , located in the Indian Ocean, is one of the last untouched places on earth . India has banned people from visiting this island or making contact with its inhabitants. There’s a tribe of indigenous people living on North Sentinel Island, and they’ve made it very clear that they don’t want to interact with outsiders. People who attempted to approach the island have either been attacked or killed. According to anthropologists, the Sentinelese have lived in seclusion on the island for more than 60,000 years. They’re also the most vulnerable people on earth, as they haven’t built up immunity to diseases like the flu. 24. The Himalayas The Himalayas are one of the most famous landmarks in Asia , and they’re known for being the highest mountain range in the world . These astonishing mountains stretch over six countries: India , Pakistan , Afghanistan , China, Bhutan and Nepal . You can find the Indian Himalayas in 13 of the country’s states, and this part of India is a true paradise for outdoor enthusiasts. 25. Wettest place on earth The rainiest spot on earth is located in Mawsynram , a town in India’s Meghalaya state. Although it doesn’t rain all day, it does rain every single day here. This popular hill station receives an average of 11861.8 mm (467 inches) of rain per year. 26. Largest producer of spices A spice market in Fort Kochi India is the largest producer, consumer and exporter of spices in the world, and therefore, it’s often called the “Land of Spices”. This country alone contributes 79% of the global spice production . Some of the most produced Indian spices are pepper, chilli, ginger, cumin, fennel, cardamom and celery. On top of that, one of the fun facts about Delhi is that this city is home to the largest spice market in Asia! 27. Origin of religions The evening Aarti in Varanasi India is called the land of unity in diversity, and it’s the birthplace of four of the world’s most important religions: Hinduism, Buddhism, Jainism and Sikhism . Hinduism is the religion that’s followed by most of India’s population today, but depending on the region, the other ones are also very present. For most Indians, religion is very important, and no matter where you are in the country, you will find plenty of religious monuments in the streets. Although these didn’t originate in the country, Christianity and Islam are also practised in India. With so many important religions originating in India, it speaks for itself that this country is a very popular destination for people seeking spirituality. Many visitors book a stay in an ashram to learn about yoga and enlightenment or pay a visit to religious cities like Varanasi and Pushkar . 28. Brilliant scientists India has been scientifically advanced since ancient times, and some of the world’s greatest contributions to science have been made by Indian scientists. Some of the country’s greatest contributions are atomism , the modern decimal system and the Chandrasekhar Limit . But India is also famous for its pharmaceutical industry , and it’s the world’s largest provider of generic medicine. 29. Selfies Taking selfies in Rajasthan If you’ve been to India as a foreigner, you will probably know what I mean by this. Walking in the streets of India feels like being a celebrity sometimes. Dozens of locals will ask if they can take a selfie with you, and why is still kind of a mystery to me, I guess Indians just love selfies. This being said, Indians don’t only take selfies with foreigners, but most locals love taking selfies in general. Whether it’s with friends, family, just themselves or tourists! 30. Large railway network India has the fourth-largest railway network in the world , right after the United States, China and Russia. The Indian railway network covers a length of over 65,000 km (40,389 mi) in total, and it operates approximately 19,000 trains every single day! So if you’re travelling in India , it’s good to know that the train is an effective way of getting around this gigantic country. 31. Mining of diamonds India was the first country to start mining diamonds, and it was the world’s only source of diamonds until the 1730s, when diamonds were found in Brazil. The earliest diamonds were found in India in the 4th century BC, and they were already considered valuable back then. People used them as jewellery, as cutting tools and as talismans to ward off evil. Starting from the 16th century, many of India’s diamonds were shipped off to Antwerp in Belgium . This city quickly became a diamond-cutting and trading centre thanks to its location. 32. Arranged marriages Although love marriages have been increasing in India, most of the weddings in India are arranged marriages . This means that the parents and relatives of a child will decide who is suitable to marry them. During the process of finding the right partner, many factors are taken into account. Arranged marriages are something the majority of Indians like to stick to, and according to research, these marriages have a higher success rate than love marriages. 33.

But, there’s more to India than its vast landmass and large population. The diverse culture, thousands of years of history, and fascinating sightseeing locations are just a few things tourists love about our country. If you are looking for in-depth information about India and insights into some less-known facts that make India a tourist-friendly country, you are in the right place. This article will walk you through the 50 amazing things that have made India a popular country! 1. Local Cricket You must have seen the Indian cricket team giving an outstanding performance on the field, but that’s not all. The craze of cricket goes beyond the stadium in India. In rural and urban areas, children can be spotted playing cricket. They don’t need a vast stadium to practice their skills. Many popular cricketers in India, now playing on a national level, have honed their cricket skills by playing on the streets. 2. Second Most Populous Country India is the seventh and second largest country in the world in terms of area and population, respectively. As of 2020, the population of India crossed the 138 crore mark. It is still less than China’s population, though. 3.Spices There is a reason India is called “the land of spices.” India supplies 75 out of 109 known spices in the world. It’s the largest spice producer, consumer, and exporter. The next time you plan a trip to India, visit the spices farm and learn about the organic methods used for producing various spices. 4.Bollywood The Hindi film industry has given us many blockbusters, talented actors, and some unforgettable dialogues that are popular worldwide. Indian cinema dates back to the 1930s. Today, Indian television stars have become so famous that they are signing Hollywood movies. To learn more about Bollywood, take a tour of the film city in Mumbai and watch the shots live! 5. Indian Food India has the best flavors and spices. From sweets to spicy foods, the country has an extensive range of cuisines that can make your day super special. A few popular dishes you must try are Butter Chicken, Tandoori Chicken, Hyderabadi Biryani, and Naan. The fun part is that you will get to sample different cuisines in different states. Each state has something unique to offer. 6. The Family Bond Nowhere can you see a family bond as strong as in India. It is probably the only country where you can find three-generation living in the same home. Unlike other places, India has a culture where the husband and wife live with their in-laws instead of starting a new life in a separate house. That’s the beauty of our country. 7. Religious Beauty Indians are super attached to their religion. A vast majority of the population follows Hinduism, some are Christian, and others follow Islam. Buddhism and Jainism are also quite popular here. People are deeply attached to their communities and the practices they are taught. 8. Marriages are Arranged Usually, kids find their partners themselves. They talk to the person, see if they are a good match, and discuss them with their parents. That’s not how marriages are always conducted in India. Parents find a suitable partner for their girl/boy child and decide who they should marry. Of course, they don’t do anything against their child’s wishes, but that’s how a wedding is generally organized here. 9. People Speak 22 Languages India is the largest country in terms of the number of official languages spoken. The country has a diverse culture with 22 languages approved as the official languages. The most common languages that Indians speak are Malayalam, Marathi, Gujarati, Punjabi, Hindi, Sanskrit, Sindhi, Tamil, Assamese, Telugu, Bengali, and Urdu. 10. Yoga Yoga has gained popularity in different parts of the world, but do you know where it originated? It started in India around 5000 years ago. Rishikesh is a training center for people who want to practice different asanas. You can become a certified Yogi after learning a few basic tricks in India. 11. Holi — The Festival of Colors If you want to see the colorful side of the country, visit here during Holi. It is the festival of colors, celebrated in all parts of India. You will spot people spraying colors on each other using water guns. 12. Culture and History India is also famous for its rich culture and history. In fact, India has the most diverse culture with many religions, foods, languages, traditions, music styles, arts, and trends. The country was ruled by the French, Portuguese, British, Dutch, and Mughal, which makes it a wonderful destination for history fans. 13. Indian Saree Another thing that’s full of colors and elegance in India is the saree. Over the past few decades, we have seen many transformations in the saree, but one thing remains constant — a variety of styles, patterns, and colors that give a beautiful touch to the outfit. Of course, there are other dresses too, but the saree is the most famous. 14. Traditional Dances Indian music and dance forms are also quite popular. Each state offers a unique dance form representing the culture of the people living there and India’s rich history. Kathak, for example, is a famous dance form in Kerala. Kuchipudi, Bharatnatyam, Bhangra, Garba, and Odissi are some popular dance forms in India. 15. Indian Curry If you have been to India before, you must have sampled India’s famous “curry-chawal.” The combo is delicious and considered the lightest form of meal. Curry can be made of fish, vegetables, chicken, and other ingredients. It is served with Naan and Rice. 16. Henna Mehndi or Henna art is a form of jewel or accessory that ladies wear during special occasions. It’s like a tattoo but is drawn with a henna cone that leaves the stain for days. You can have it drawn on your hand with a henna artist. You will love the fresh fragrance and the color. 17.Hockey The national sport of India, Hockey, might not be as famous as cricket. But it’s still one of the specialties of the country. The Indian hockey team delivered a phenomenal performance in the 20th century Olympics, which made hockey the nation’s national sport. 18.Tigers India is home to 70% of the world’s tiger population, with around 2,200 tigers found in national parks. You can easily spot a wild tiger in your national park or a wildlife sanctuary tour in India. 19.The Golden Temple This two-storied architecture in Amritsar is the most sacred location for Sikhs. Every year, hundreds of thousands of tourists visit The Golden Temple. It has a golden dome and is built of marble. The temple isn’t only a sacred place, but it represents human brotherhood. It also feeds over 100,000 pilgrims every day. 20. Indian Weddings Indian weddings are not as simple as western weddings. The preparations start weeks before the wedding rituals, and people invite a lot of guests. Like other specialties of India, weddings in India are full of colors, decorations, guests, a variety of cuisines, and a lot of fun. Rituals are performed based on the couples’ religion. They celebrate weddings with songs, dance, and many rituals that start days before the actual wedding day. 21. Pharmaceutical Industry India’s pharmaceutical industry is worth more than $40 billion. India is also one of the largest exporters of general medicine. Many qualified and professional scientists who are known to discover unimaginable treatments or medications are in India. 22.Kamasutra For a country that hushes people when it comes to intimate talks, it’s surprising to say that Kamasutra originated in Northern India.

Statue of Unity The world’s tallest statue, the Statue of Unity, is in India.

Kumbh Mela If you have been to India, you must have probably heard of Kumbh Mela. It attracts hundreds of thousands of tourists from all parts of India. In 2019, Kumbh Mela was hosted in Allahabad when over 220 million people visited the site. 26. The Floating Post Office India’s floating post office is located on Dal’s Lake, one of the most attractive locations in Srinagar. The post office started in 2011. Since then, it has made Jammu & Kashmir an iconic location for locals and international tourists. 27.Ayurveda Ayurveda medicines started in India and have existed since the Vedic era. These medications are made using herbs and medicinal plants found in different corners of India. Ayurveda focuses on a holistic approach to treating various diseases. This oldest and most traditional medical system is still as popular as it was before modern science progressed. 28. Snakes & Ladders The popular pastime game “snakes and ladders” came from India. It is believed that the board was developed to teach children moral behaviors. The ladder represented good deeds, while the snake was considered evil. Today, snakes and ladders is played in western countries and has become a popular pastime for children and adults. 29.

(more) For almost all Indians the family is the most important social unit. India had a strong preference for extended families, consisting of two or more married couples (often of more than a single generation), who share finances and a common kitchen, but with modernization and urbanization, nuclear households (a married couple or a man or a woman living alone or with unmarried children with or without unrelated individuals) have become more common. In fact, according to the National Family Health Survey (NFHS-5), conducted in 2019–21, more than half the number of households in both urban and rural India are nuclear. Traditionally, marriage was virtually universal, divorce rare, and almost every marriage produced children. Today, even though India’s divorce rate is low compared to many other nations, the separation rate is thrice the divorce rate. Most marriages are arranged by family elders on the basis of caste, degree of consanguinity, economic status, education (if any), and astrology. A bride traditionally moves to her husband ’s house. However, nonarranged “love marriages” are increasingly common in cities. News • Air pollution levels surge in India's capital, sparking rare protests • Nov. 10, 2025, 12:10 PM ET (AP) ...

The senior male of the household—whether father, grandfather, or uncle—typically is the recognized family head, and his wife is the person who regulates the tasks assigned to female family members. Males enjoy higher status than females; boys are often pampered while girls are relatively neglected. This is reflected in significantly different rates of mortality and morbidity between the sexes, allegedly (though reliable statistics are lacking) in occasional female infanticide , and increasingly in the abortion of female fetuses following prenatal gender testing. With time, slight improvements have been seen in women’s participation in decisions about their own earnings (from 82 percent in 2015−16 to 85 percent in 2019–21) and about major household purchases (73 percent in 2015−16 to 80 percent in 2019–21). The preference for male children is largely connected to the institution of dowry , since the family’s obligation to provide a suitable dowry to the bride’s new family represents a major financial liability. Although the practice of dowry was made illegal in 1961, there have been reports of dowry-related harassment in recent years. Traditionally, women were expected to treat their husbands as if they were gods, and obedience of wives to husbands was a strong social norm . This expectation of devotion may follow a husband to the grave; within some caste groups, widows are not allowed to remarry even if they are bereaved at a young age. Hindu marriage has traditionally been viewed as the “gift of a maiden” ( kanyadan ) from the bride’s father to the household of the groom. This gift is also accompanied by a dowry, which generally consists of items suitable to start a young couple in married life. In some cases, however, dowries demanded by grooms and their families have become quite extravagant , and some families appear to regard them as means of enrichment. The practice of giving and accepting dowry was made illegal in India with the enactment of the Dowry Prevention Act, 1961. There are still instances, however, a few of which have been highly publicized, wherein young brides have been treated abusively—even tortured and murdered—in an effort to extract more wealth from the bride’s father. The “dowry deaths” of such young women have contributed to a reaction against the dowry in some modern urban families. A Muslim marriage is considered to be a contractual relationship—contracted by the bride’s father or guardian—and, though there are often dowries, there is formal reciprocity , in which the groom promises a mahr , a commitment to provide his bride with wealth in her lifetime. Beyond the family the most important unit is the caste. Within a village all members of a single caste recognize a fictive kinship relation and a sense of mutual obligation, but ideas of fictive kinship extend also to the village as a whole. Thus, for example, a woman who marries and goes to another village never ceases to be regarded as a daughter of her village. If she is badly treated in her husband’s village, it may become a matter of collective concern for her natal village, not merely for those of her own caste.

(more) Virtually all regions of India have their distinctive places of pilgrimage, local saints and folk heroes, religious festivals, and associated fairs. There are also innumerable festivals associated with individual villages or temples or with specific castes and cults. Some popular Hindu festivals celebrated across the greater part of India include Holi , celebrated on the full-moon day of the month Phalguna (February–March), when celebrants throw colored water and powder at one another; Dussehra , the 10th day of the month Ashvina (September–October), when the story of the Ramayana is reenacted; and Diwali (also spelled Divali), lasting for 5 days from the 13th day of the dark half of the lunar month Ashvina to the 2nd day of the light half of the lunar month Karttika (October–November), a time for lighting lamps and exchanging gifts. Islamic festivals include Eid al-Fitr (any season depending on the lunar calendar ), which marks the end of Ramadan , the Muslim holy month of fasting. Sikh festivals are also a major part of the festival calendar. Among these is Guru Nanak Jayanti (also known as Gurupurab), which commemorates the birth anniversary of Guru Nanak , the founder of Sikhism ; it is celebrated on the 15th lunar day in the month Karttika (usually November). The major secular holidays include Independence Day (August 15), Republic Day (January 26), and Gandhi Jayanti (October 2, Mahatma Gandhi ’s birth anniversary). Joseph E. Schwartzberg The Editors of Encyclopaedia Britannica Cuisine Chicken biryani in Delhi A vendor preparing chicken biryani on the streets of Old Delhi, India. (more) India does not have a single cuisine . Its wide variety of climates, soil types, cultures , and religions, as well as influences from other countries, produce a diverse range of cuisines that can be grouped under the term Indian cuisine . As a whole, Indian cuisine can be dated to the prehistoric period, and it can be found around the world wherever there is a significant Indian diaspora . Pulses (edible seeds from plants of the legume family) and grains are among the key portions of the Indian diet. Dal, a Hindi word that refers to both raw and cooked lentils, may be the closest thing India has to a national dish. The cuisine of northern India shows the influence of the Islamic conquest. Dairy products such as milk, ghee , and paneer (cottage cheese) are commonly used there, and many vegetables are cooked in yogurt or onion-and-tomato–based gravies. The cuisine of northeastern India is rice-based—rice is grown on terraced fields in the region’s hilly terrain—and freshwater fish appears in many dishes, as does pork, beef, mutton, and chicken. In southern India rice is the staple food, and it is eaten with sambhar, a watery stew comprising lentil, tamarind, and vegetables. Southern India is also home to a range of diverse cuisines—Andhra, Tamil, Chettinad, Kerala , and Mangalore , among others. The west coast of India also has distinct cuisines that vary across Goa (where rice and fish are the staples), Maharashtra , and Gujarat (which is predominantly vegetarian). Spices and herbs are a predominant feature of Indian cooking, and spices indigenous to India were an important driver of European exploration of the world in the 15th and 16th centuries. Food is typically eaten by hand across India, with minimal use of cutlery. Sanat Pai Raikar"

Many sources describe it as “Sa Prathama Sanskrati Vishvavara” — the first and the supreme culture in the world, according to the All World Gayatri Pariwar (AWGP) organization. Western societies did not always see the culture of India very favorably, according to Christina De Rossi, an anthropologist at Barnet and Southgate College in London. Early anthropologists once considered culture as an evolutionary process, and “every aspect of human development was seen as driven by evolution,” she told Live Science. “In this view, societies outside of Europe or North America, or societies that did not follow the European or Western way of life, were considered primitive and culturally inferior. Essentially this included all the colonized countries and people, such as African countries, India, and the Far East.” However, Indians made significant advances in architecture (Taj Mahal), mathematics (the invention of zero) and medicine (Ayurveda). Today, India is a very diverse country, with more than 1.2 billion people, according to the CIA World Factbook, making it the second most populous nation after China. Different regions have their own distinct cultures. Language, religion, food and the arts are just some of the various aspects of Indian culture. Language India has 28 states and seven territories, according to the World Health Organization. There is no official language in India, according to a Gujarat High Court ruling in 2010, though Hindi is the official language of the government. The Constitution of India officially recognizes 23 official languages. Many people living in India write in Devanagari script. In fact, it is a misconception that the majority of people in India speak Hindi. Though many people speak Hindi in India, 59 percent of India residents speak something other than Hindi, according to The Times of India. Bengali, Telugu, Marathi, Tamil and Urdu are some other languages spoken in the country. Sanskrit, an ancient Indo-European language usually referred to in action movies, came from Northern India. How the language started has been a point of argument amongst linguists. It shares many similarities with English, French, Farsi and Russian languages. New DNA research in 2017 found that an Aryan invasion may have introduced the beginnings of Sanskrit. “People have been debating the arrival of the Indo-European languages in India for hundreds of years,” said study co-author Martin Richards, an archaeogeneticist at the University of Huddersfield in England. “There’s been a very long-running debate about whether the Indo-European languages were brought from migrations from outside, which is what most linguists would accept, or if they evolved indigenously.” [Aryan Invasion May Have Transformed India’s Bronze-Age Population] Religion India is identified as the birthplace of Hinduism and Buddhism, the third and fourth largest religions. About 84 percent of the population identifies as Hindu, according to the “Handbook of Research on Development and Religion,” edited by Matthew Clarke (Edward Elgar Publishing, 2013). There are many variations of Hinduism, and four predominant sects — Shaiva, Vaishnava, Shakteya and Smarta. About 13 percent of Indians are Muslim, making it one of the largest Islamic nations in the world. Christians and Sikhs make up a small percentage of the population, and there are even fewer Buddhists and Jains, according to the “Handbook.” The CIA cited similar figures. According to its World Factbook, around 80 percent of the population is Hindu, 14.2 percent is Muslim, 2.3 percent is Christian, 1.7 percent is Sikh and 2 percent is unspecified. Food When the Moghul Empire invaded during the sixteenth century, they left a significant mark on the Indian cuisine, according to Texas A&M University. Indian cuisine is also influenced by many other countries. It is known for its large assortment of dishes and its liberal use of herbs and spices. Cooking styles vary from region to region. Wheat, Basmati rice and pulses with chana (Bengal gram) are important staples of the Indian diet. The food is rich with curries and spices, including ginger, coriander, cardamom, turmeric, dried hot peppers, and cinnamon, among others. Chutneys — thick condiments and spreads made from assorted fruits and vegetables such as tamarind and tomatoes and mint, cilantro and other herbs — are used generously in Indian cooking. Many Hindus are vegetarian, but lamb and chicken are common in main dishes for non-vegetarians. The Guardian reports that between 20 percent and 40 percent of India’s population is vegetarian. Much of Indian food is eaten with fingers or bread used as utensils. There is a wide array of breads served with meals, including naan, a leavened, oven-baked flatbread; and bhatoora, a fried, fluffy flatbread common in North India and eaten with chickpea curry. Architecture and art The most well-known example of Indian architecture is the Taj Mahal, built by Mughal emperor Shah Jahan to honor his third wife, Mumtaz Mahal. It combines elements from Islamic, Persian, Ottoman Turkish and Indian architectural styles. India also has many ancient temples. India is well known for its film industry, which is often referred to as Bollywood. The country’s movie history began in 1896 when the Lumière brothers demonstrated the art of cinema in Mumbai, according to the Golden Globes. Today, the films are known for their elaborate singing and dancing. Indian dance, music and theater traditions span back more than 2,000 years, according to Nilima Bhadbhade, author of “Contract Law in India” (Kluwer Law International, 2010). The major classical dance traditions — Bharata Natyam, Kathak, Odissi, Manipuri, Kuchipudi, Mohiniattam and Kathakali — draw on themes from mythology and literature and have rigid presentation rules. A study published in April 2016 in the Journal of Indian Ocean Archaeology found that some Indian horns have many similarities with horns made in Ireland. This research may suggest that the two countries may have exchanged ideas and techniques in making musical instruments during the Bronze Age. “Some horns are frankly shockingly similar, to the point where it is like witnessing time travel,” study author Billy Ó Foghlú, an archaeologist and doctoral student at the Australian National University in Canberra, told Live Science. “If I were to find one of these modern Indian instruments in an Irish archaeological excavation and I didn’t know what I was looking at, I would likely assume it was a Late Bronze Age Irish artifact.” [Surprising Echo of Ancient Irish Horns in Indian Instruments] Clothing Indian clothing is closely identified with the colorful silk saris worn by many of the country’s women. A traditional piece of clothing for men is the dhoti, an unstitched piece of cloth that is tied around the waist and legs. Men also wear a kurta, a loose shirt that is worn about knee-length. For special occasions, men wear a sherwani or achkan, which is a long coat that with a collar having no lapel. It is buttoned up to the collar and down to the knees. A shorter version of a sherwani is called a Nehru jacket. It is named after Jawaharlal Nehru, India’s prime minister from 1947 to 1964, but Nehru never wore a Nehru jacket. He preferred the achkan, according to Tehelka, an Indian newspaper. The Nehru jacket was primarily marketed to Westerners. Customs and celebrations Diwali is the largest and most important holiday to India, according to National Geographic. It is a five-day festival known as the festival of lights because of the lights lit during the celebration to symbolize the inner light that protects them from spiritual darkness. Holi, the festival of colors, also called the festival of love, is popular in the spring. The country also celebrates Republic Day (Jan. 26), Independence Day (Aug. 15) and Mahatma Gandhi’s birthday (Oct. 2).

These cultural aspects differ widely across India’s 28 states and seven territories, and many of them stem from ancient Indian scriptures and texts, which paved the way of life in India for centuries. Our 10 customs and traditions in Indian culture will show you just a few of them. 10 Customs and Traditions in Indian Culture Our guide is here to show you some of India’s most popular customs and traditions, to give you a feel for this amazing country and to learn a little more if you’re planning to visit. Greetings One of the most popular customs and traditions in Indian culture is the Namaste greeting, sometimes called namaskar or namaskaram, translating as ‘I bow to the divine in you’. This respectful way of saying hello, goodbye, and thank you has seen a huge uptake around the world during the Coronavirus outbreak as an alternative to handshakes and hugs. The gesture is performed by placing the palms together in prayer pose in front of the chest, fingers pointing upwards, and making a slight bow. Another popular saying is ‘Atithi Devo Bhava’, a Sanskrit verse from Hindu scriptures that translates as ‘the guest is equivalent to god’. In Indian culture, guests have always been given supreme importance. You might also encounter the Indian head shake which can mean yes, thank you or indicate understanding, depending on the context of the conversation. Families It’s a family affair for the next of our customs and traditions in Indian culture. A joint family in India is where the entire family all live together, which can include parents, wife, children and occasionally relatives. At the head of the family is a ‘Karta’, a senior male or female who makes economic and social decisions on behalf of the entire family, and other relations can be equal, of mutual respect or teasing in nature. Income goes into a common pool, which benefits all members. Nowadays, economic development and urbanisation have led to an increase in nuclear-like families than joint families. Arranged marriage is still a strong tradition in India. This dates back to Vedic times in 1500–1100 BCE where suitable matches from around the kingdom would compete in competitions to win the hand of a royal bride. Food One of our favourite customs and traditions in Indian culture is food! Every region in India has its own distinct cuisine with a signature dish or ingredient. It’s one of the best countries for vegetarian cuisine, which you’ll find predominantly in Gujarat and Rajasthan. Non-vegetarian options feature strongly in Bengali, Mughlai, North Indian and Punjabi cuisine, and Kerala in South India is famous for its delicious fish dishes. You can always guarantee plenty of fresh ingredients, including wonderful herbs and spices used for flavour, aromas, to enhance colours and for healing properties. Although many restaurants provide cutlery for tourists, it’s great to get involved with the Indian tradition of eating with your hands. As well as immersing yourself in Indian culture, your digestive system will thank you as it means you eat more slowly. Wash your hands thoroughly before and after, and use your right hand to eat. Religion India is a land where people from different religions coexist harmoniously. 79.8% of the population worship Hinduism, 14.2% Islam, 2.3% Christianity, 1.7% Sikhism, 0.7% Buddhism and 0.4% Jainism. The cow is a sacred animal in Hindu culture and is depicted in mythology as accompanying several gods such as Shiva on his bull Nandi, or Krishna, the cowherd god. The horns represent the gods, the four legs are ‘Vedas’ (ancient Hindu scriptures) and the udder is the four objectives of life – desire, material wealth, righteousness and salvation. Consuming beef or killing a cow is considered sinful, and it is illegal to slaughter a cow in several states. Fasts (‘Vrats’ or ‘Upvas’) are a key part of Indian culture, as a means of giving thanks to Gods and Goddesses and of showing resolve and sincerity. It is thought that by going without the necessity of food you will cleanse yourself of sin. Fasts are observed through India on various days and on a range of religious occasions. Temples Exploring Indian temples is a magical experience, but there are a few things to remember before you visit. Many of these sacred buildings were deliberately built at places rich in positive energy from the magnetic wave lines of the Earth. Most temples feature one main idol, which has a copper plate called the Garbhagriha or Moolasthan underneath that absorbs and resonates this underground energy. One of the customs and traditions in Indian culture is to have a bath or shower before entering a temple or at least wash your hands and feet to cleanse yourself of negative thoughts and evil influences. Appropriate attire is really important, namely conservative clothing to indicate respect. Women should ideally wear a modest top and a calf or ankle-length skirt or trousers that will allow sitting comfortably cross-legged on the floor. Men should wear trousers and a shirt. Avoid wearing leather or animal skin of any kind, as this is offensive to practising Hindus. You will also need to remove your footwear before entering places of worship to prevent any dirt from coming into a cleansed and sanctified environment. A top tip is to choose shoes that are easy to remove. If you’d prefer to keep your socks on, that’s fine: just make sure they are clean and free from holes!

Festivals Next on our list of customs and traditions in Indian culture is festivals. There are hundreds of celebrations to experience in India, meaning that every day holds a new celebration. The huge variety of festivals represents India’s rich culture and traditions, with state-wide, religion-based, and community-focused festivals on offer. Hindus celebrate Diwali, Holi and Makar Sakranti, Muslims observe  Eid, Baisakhi (crop harvesting) is a Sikh festival, Jains commemorate Mahavir Jayanti and Buddhists mark Buddha’s birthday. Christmas and Good Friday are celebrated by Christians too. Then there are festivals to honour saints, public figures and gurus. Indian festivals can feature ornate idols in extravagant parades, specific food dishes, dancing and music, sacred rituals and vibrant colours. There are also well-being, yoga and walking festivals. Unlike many festivals around the world which can be boozy affairs, many ‘dry days’ where the sale of alcohol is prohibited fall on major national Indian festivals and occasions. Why not incorporate a festival into your tour for the chance to be part of community celebrations and create magical holiday memories? Clothing Clothes in India depend on the climate, cultural traditions and ethnicity of each region. Both male and female clothing has progressed from simple garments covering the body (sari, dhoti, gamcha, kaupina, langota, lungi and loincloths) into intricate costumes used not only in daily wear but also on festive occasions, rituals and dance performances. You’ll see western clothing worn by people of all social levels in urban areas. Traditional Indian clothing often showcases fantastic skills passed down from generations, including embroidery, embellishment and printing, as well as ornate textiles such as fine silk. Clothing may be worn in particular colours to represent a religion or a particular ritual. Dancing India offers a wide variety of dance forms which vary throughout each state. The Hindu Sanskrit ‘ Natyashashtra’ (text of performing arts) recognises eight Indian classical dances, which includes Kathak in North, West and Central India, with East India showcasing Sattriya from Assam, Manipuri from Manipur and Oddisi from Odhisa. In South India, you can witness the Kuchipudi in Andhra Pradesh, Bharatnatyam in Tamil Nadu, Kathakali and Mohiniyattam in Kerala. These dance forms have dramatic narratives, with performers telling stories mostly from mythology through gestures and movement. Indian folk dances are also based on stories, this time passed down through generations. These dances are popular in rural areas with performances showing the everyday life of villagers.

Literature India has many great epics dating back many centuries in the form of stories, poems, plays and self-help guides. The two most famous Hindu epics are the Ramayana and Mahabharata, which both contain thrilling tales of gods and demons, love and war and chariots and kidnappings. These stories have been told and retold for thousands of years and play a huge part in the customs and traditions in Indian culture. The Ramayana tells the story of Rama, prince of the legendary kingdom of Kosala, and follows his fourteen-year exile to the forest urged by his father King Dasharatha. The Mahabharata is the longest poem that has been written in Sanskrit. Both epics tell of good triumphing over evil and show the values of devotion, loyalty, sacrifice and truth. Image from Pixabay Language The last in our list of customs and traditions in Indian culture is language. India is a land of many fascinating languages and dialects which can change even within a few miles. There are more than 19,500 mother tongues, 415 living languages, and 23 constitutionally recognised official languages in India. Hindi is spoken by 41% of the population, particularly in the north, and 12% of Indians can speak English as a second language. Many people living in India write in the Devanagari script, developed between the 1st and 4th centuries. The script contains 47 primary characters including 14 vowels and 33 consonants and is written from left to right. The characters have symmetrical rounded shapes within squared outlines and are all written in the same case, without any capitalisation.

In this article, the subcontinent, which for historical purposes is usually called simply “India,” is understood to comprise the areas of not only the present-day Republic of India (free from British rule since August 15, 1947, celebrated as the country’s Independence Day ) but also the republics of Pakistan (partitioned from India in 1947) and Bangladesh (which formed the eastern part of Pakistan until its independence in 1971).

Toward the south it is effectively sheltered by wide expanses of ocean, which tended to isolate it culturally in ancient times, while to the north it is protected by the massive ranges of the Himalayas , which also sheltered it from the Arctic winds and the air currents of Central Asia . Only in the northwest and northeast is there easier access by land, and it was through those two sectors that most of the early contacts with the outside world took place. Within the framework of hills and mountains represented by the Indo-Iranian borderlands on the west, the Indo-Myanmar borderlands in the east, and the Himalayas to the north, the subcontinent may in broadest terms be divided into two major divisions: in the north, the basins of the Indus and Ganges (Ganga) rivers (the Indo-Gangetic Plain ) and, to the south, the block of Archean rocks that forms the Deccan plateau region. The expansive alluvial plain of the river basins provided the environment and focus for the rise of two great phases of city life: the civilization of the Indus valley, known as the Indus civilization , during the 3rd millennium bce ; and, during the 1st millennium bce , that of the Ganges. To the south of this zone, and separating it from the peninsula proper, is a belt of hills and forests, running generally from west to east and to this day largely inhabited by tribal people. This belt has played mainly a negative role throughout Indian history in that it remained relatively thinly populated and did not form the focal point of any of the principal regional cultural developments of South Asia. However, it is traversed by various routes linking the more-attractive areas north and south of it. The Narmada (Narbada) River flows through this belt toward the west, mostly along the Vindhya Range , which has long been regarded as the symbolic boundary between northern and southern India. The northern parts of India represent a series of contrasting regions, each with its own distinctive cultural history and its own distinctive population. In the northwest the valleys of the Baluchistan uplands (now largely in Balochistan , Pakistan) are a low-rainfall area, producing mainly wheat and barley and having a low density of population. Its residents, mainly tribal people, are in many respects closely akin to their Iranian neighbors. The adjacent Indus plains are also an area of extremely low rainfall, but the annual flooding of the river in ancient times and the exploitation of its waters by canal irrigation in the modern period have enhanced agricultural productivity, and the population is correspondingly denser than that of Baluchistan. The Indus valley may be divided into three parts: in the north are the plains of the five tributary rivers of the Punjab (Persian: Panjāb, “Five Waters”); in the center the consolidated waters of the Indus and its tributaries flow through the alluvial plains of Sind; and in the south the waters pass naturally into the Indus delta. East of the latter is the Great Indian Desert, also called the Thar Desert , which is in turn bounded on the east by a hill system known as the Aravali Range , the northernmost extent of the Deccan plateau region. Beyond them is the hilly region of Rajasthan and the Malwa Plateau . To the south is the Kathiawar Peninsula , forming both geographically and culturally an extension of Rajasthan . All of these regions have a relatively denser population than the preceding group, but for topographical reasons they have tended to be somewhat isolated, at least during historical times. East of the Punjab and Rajasthan, northern India develops into a series of belts running broadly west to east and following the line of the foothills of the Himalayan ranges in the north. The southern belt consists of a hilly, forested area broken by the numerous escarpments in close association with the Vindhya Range, including the Bhander, Rewa , and Kaimur plateaus. Between the hills of central India and the Himalayas lies the Ganges River valley proper, constituting an area of high-density population, moderate rainfall, and high agricultural productivity. Archaeology suggests that, from the beginning of the 1st millennium bce , rice cultivation has played a large part in supporting this population. The Ganges valley divides into three major parts: to the west is the Ganges-Yamuna Doab (the land area that is formed by the confluence of the two rivers); east of the confluence lies the middle Ganges valley, in which population tends to increase and cultivation of rice predominates; and to the southeast lies the extensive delta of the combined Ganges and Brahmaputra rivers. The Brahmaputra flows from the northeast, rising from the Tibetan Himalayas and emerging from the mountains into the Assam valley, being bounded on the east by the Patkai Bum Range and the Naga Hills and on the south by the Mikir, Khasi , Jaintia , and Garo hills. There is plenty of evidence that influences reached India from the northeast in ancient times, even if they are less prominent than those that arrived from the northwest. Along the Deccan plateau there is a gradual eastward declivity, which dispenses its major river systems—the Mahanadi , Godavari , Krishna , and Kaveri (Cauvery)—into the Bay of Bengal . Rising some 3,000 feet (1,000 meters) or more along the western edge of the Deccan, the escarpment known as the Western Ghats traps the moisture of winds from the Arabian Sea , most notably during the southwest monsoon , creating a tropical monsoon climate along the narrow western littoral and depriving the Deccan of significant precipitation. The absence of snowpack in the south Indian uplands makes the region dependent entirely on rainfall for its streamflow. The arrival of the southwest monsoon in June is thus a pivotal annual event in peninsular culture . India from the Paleolithic Period to the decline of the Indus civilization The earliest periods of Indian history are known only through reconstructions from archaeological evidence. Since the late 20th century, much new data has emerged, allowing a far fuller reconstruction than was formerly possible. This section will discuss five major periods: (1) the early prehistoric period (before the 8th millennium bce ), (2) the period of the prehistoric agriculturalists and pastoralists (approximately the 8th to the mid-4th millennium bce ), (3) the Early Indus, or Early Harappan, Period (so named for the excavated city of Harappa in eastern Pakistan), witnessing the emergence of the first cities in the Indus River system (c. 3500–2600 bce ), (4) the Indus, or Harappan, civilization (c. 2600–2000 bce , or perhaps ending as late as 1750 bce ), and (5) the Post-Urban Period, which follows the Indus civilization and precedes the rise of cities in northern India during the second quarter of the 1st millennium bce (c. 1750–750 bce ). The materials available for a reconstruction of the history of India prior to the 3rd century bce are almost entirely the products of archaeological research. Traditional and textual sources, transmitted orally for many centuries, are available from the closing centuries of the 2nd millennium bce , but their use depends largely on the extent to which any passage can be dated or associated with archaeological evidence. For the rise of civilization in the Indus valley and for contemporary events in other parts of the subcontinent, the evidence of archaeology is still the principal source of information. Even when it becomes possible to read the short inscriptions of the Harappan seals, it is unlikely that they will provide much information to supplement other sources. In those circumstances it is necessary to approach the early history of India largely through the eyes of the archaeologists, and it will be wise to retain a balance between an objective assessment of archaeological data and its synthetic interpretation. The early prehistoric period In the mid-19th century, archaeologists in southern India identified hand axes comparable to those of Stone Age Europe. For nearly a century thereafter, evaluation of a burgeoning body of evidence consisted in the attempt to correlate Indian chronologies with the well-documented European and Mediterranean chronologies. As the vast majority of early finds were from surface sites, they long remained without precise dates or cultural contexts . More recently, however, the excavation of numerous cave and dune sites has yielded artifacts in association with organic material that can be dated using the carbon-14 method, and the techniques of thermoluminescent and paleomagnetic analysis now permit dating of pottery fragments and other inorganic materials. Research beginning in the late 20th century has focused on the unique environment of the subcontinent as the context for a cultural evolution analogous to, but not uniform with, that of other regions. Increasing understanding of plate tectonics , to cite one development, has greatly advanced this endeavor. Most outlines of Indian prehistory have employed nomenclature once thought to reflect a worldwide sequence of human cultural evolution. The European concept of the Old Stone Age, or Paleolithic Period (comprising Lower, Middle, and Upper stages), remains useful with regard to South Asia in identifying levels of technology, apart from any universal time line. Similarly, what has been called the Indian Mesolithic Period (Middle Stone Age) corresponds in general typological terms to that of Europe. For the subsequent periods, the designations Neolithic Period (New Stone Age) and Chalcolithic Age (Copper-Stone Age) also are applied, but increasingly, as archaeology has yielded more-detailed cultural profiles for those periods, scholars have come to emphasize the subsistence bases of early societies—e.g., hunting and gathering, pastoralism, and agriculture. The terms Early Harappan and Harappan (from the site where remains of a major city of the Indus civilization were discovered in 1921) are used primarily in a chronological way but also loosely in a cultural sense, relating respectively to periods or cultures that preceded the appearance of city life in the Indus valley and to the Indus civilization itself."

The history of India starts with the existence of India itself as It located in the continent of Asia, India covers 2,973,193 square kilometers of land and 314,070 square kilometers of water. Making it the 7th largest nation in the world with a total area of 3,287,263 square kilometers. Surrounded by Bhutan, Nepal, and Bangladesh to the North East, China to the North, Pakistan to the North West, and Sri Lanka on the South East coast. India is a land of ancient civilizations. India's social, economic, and cultural configurations are the products of a long process of regional expansion. Indian history begins with the birth of the Indus Valley Civilization and the coming of the Aryans. These two phases are usually described as the pre-Vedic and Vedic age. Hinduism arose in the Vedic period. The fifth-century saw the unification of India under Ashoka, who had converted to Buddhism, and it is in his reign that Buddhism spread in many parts of Asia. In the eighth century, Islam came to India for the first time and by the eleventh century had firmly established itself in India as a political force. It resulted in the formation of the Delhi Sultanate, which was finally succeeded by the Mughal Empire, under which India once again achieved a large measure of political unity. It was in the 17th century that the Europeans came to India. This coincided with the disintegration of the Mughal Empire, paving the way for regional states. In the contest for supremacy, the English emerged 'victors'. The Rebellion of 1857-58, which sought to restore Indian supremacy, was crushed; and with the subsequent crowning of Victoria as Empress of India, the incorporation of India into the empire was complete. It was followed by India's struggle for independence, which we got in the year 1947. Here is a brief timeline about the history of India: Ancient India History The History of India begins with the Indus Valley Civilization and the coming of the Aryans. These two phases are generally described as the pre-Vedic and Vedic periods. The earliest literary source that sheds light on India's past is the Rig Veda. It is difficult to date this work with any accuracy on the basis of tradition and ambiguous astronomical information contained in the hymns. Indus valley civilization, which flourished between 2800 BC and 1800 BC, had an advanced and flourishing economic system. The Indus valley people practiced agriculture, domesticated animals, made tools and weapons from copper, bronze, and tin and even traded with some Middle East countries. The Indus Valley Civilization A long time ago, in the eastern world, there rose a few civilizations. The main reasons for the rise of these urban civilizations were access to rivers, which served various functions of human beings. Along with the Mesopotamian civilization and the Egyptian civilization, rose the Indus Valley civilization spanning Northwest India and modern-day Pakistan. The largest amongst the three civilizations, the Indus Valley civilization flourished around 2600 BC, at which time agriculture in India started flourishing. The fertile Indus valley made it possible for agriculture to be carried out on a large scale. The most well-known towns of the Indus Valley in today’s date are Mohenjo Daro and Harappa. Unearthing these two towns showed excavators glimpses into the richness of the Indus Valley civilization, evidenced in ruins and things like household articles, war weapons, gold and silver ornament - and so on. The people of the Indus Valley civilization lived in well-planned towns and well-designed houses made of baked bricks. In an era of developments and prosperity, civilization, unfortunately, came to an end by around 1300 BC, mainly due to natural calamities. Vedic Civilization The next era that India saw was that of the Vedic civilization, flourishing along the river Saraswati, named after the Vedas, which depict the early literature of the Hindus. The two greatest epics of this period were the Ramayana and the Mahabharata, still held in great reverence by the followers of Hinduism. Buddhist Era Next came the Buddhist era, during the time of the Mahajanapadas which were the sixteen great powers, during the 7th and the 6th centuries BC. Prominent powers at the time were the Sakyas of Kapilavastu and the Licchavis of Vaishali. Buddha, whose original name was Siddhartha Gautam, was born in Lumbini near Kapilavastu and was the founder of Buddhism - a religion based on spiritualism. He died at the age of 80 in 480 BC but his teachings spread throughout southern and eastern Asia and are followed across the world today. The Invasion of Alexander When Alexander invaded India in 326 BC, he crossed the Indus river and defeated the Indian rulers in battle. Noteworthy of the Indians’ attempts at war, was the use of elephants, something that the Macedonians had never seen before. Alexander then took over the lands of the defeated kings. The Gupta Dynasty The Gupta period has been referred to as the Golden Age of Indian history. When Chandragupta I received the gift of Pataliputra in dowry when he married the daughter of the chief of the ‘Licchavis’, he started to lay down the foundation of his empire, which extended from the river Ganges or the Ganga to the city of Allahabad. He ruled for 15 years and was also referred to as the ‘king of kings’ for his strategic conquests and the flourishing state of India. Harshavardhana The last of the ancient kingdoms in India was by the king Harshavardhana, who ascended the throne at Thanneshwar and Kannauj after his brother died. While successful in a few of his conquests, he eventually got defeated by the Chalukya Kingdom of Deccan India. Harshavardhana was well-known for establishing relations with the Chinese, and also for having high religious tolerance and strong administrative capabilities. Medieval Indian History The medieval history of India is renowned for deriving a lot of its character from Islamic kingdoms. Extending across almost three generations, medieval India included a number of kingdoms and dynasties: -    The Chalukyas -    The Pallavas -    The Pandyas -    The Rashtrakutas -    The Cholas The Cholas were the most important rulers at this time, the 9th Century AD. Their kingdom covered a large part of South India, including Sri Lanka and the Maldives. While the rulers ruled bravely and carried out the annexation of multiple territories in India, the empire came to an end in the 14th Century AD with an invasion by a man named Kafur Malik. The monuments from the Chola Dynasty are still intact and are known for their rustic charm. The next major empire was that of the Mughals, preceded by a rise in Islamic rulers. The invasion of Timur was a significant point in Indian history before a Hindu revival movement called the Bhakti movement, came to be. Finally, in the 16th Century, the Mughal empire started to rise. One of the greatest empires of India, the Mughal empire was a rich and glorious one, with the whole of India united and ruled by one monarch. The Mughal Kings were Babar, Humayun, Sher Shah Suri (not a Mughal king), Akbar, Jehangir, Shah Jahan, and Aurangzeb. They were responsible for setting up efficient public administration, laying out infrastructure, and promoting the arts. A large number of monuments in India today exist from the Mughal period. The death of the last Mughal King, Aurangzeb, sowed the seeds of disintegration within India. Influencers of Islamic architecture in India, the Mughal kings are still looked back in awe. Akbar Emperor Akbar, also known as Akbar the Great or Jalaluddin Muhammad Akbar, was the third emperor of the Mughal Empire, after Babur and Humayun. He was the son of Nasiruddin Humayun and succeeded him as the emperor in the year 1556 when he was only 13 years old. Shah Jahan Shah Jahan, also known as Shahbuddin Mohammed Shah Jahan, was a Mughal Emperor who ruled in the Indian Subcontinent from 1628 to 1658. He was the fifth Mughal ruler, after Babur, Humayun, Akbar, and Jahangir. Shah Jahan succeeded the throne after revolting against his father, Jahangir. Chhatrapati Shivaji Chatrapati Shivaji Maharaj was the founder of the Maratha Empire in western India. He is considered to be one of the greatest warriors of his time and even today, stories of his exploits are narrated as a part of the folklore. King Shivaji used the guerrilla tactics to capture a part of, the then, dominant Mughal empire. Modern Indian History During the late 16th and the 17th Centuries, the European trading companies in India competed with each other ferociously. By the last quarter of the 18th Century, the English had outdone all others and established themselves as the dominant power in India. The British administered India for a period of about two centuries and brought about revolutionary changes in the social, political and economic life of the country. However, the zenith of colonisation was achieved when the British arrived in the early 1600s as traders. Capitalizing on the disintegration that existed in India after the Mughal rule, the British actively used the strategy of ‘divide-and-rule’ to rule over India for over 2 centuries. While the British had come in earlier, they only achieved political power in 1757 AD after the Battle of Plassey. They took a keen interest in the resources that India had to offered and have been looked back at as plunderers of India’s wealth of resources - as they took cotton, spices, silk, and tea, amongst numerous other resources. While they did lay out a massive chunk of India’s infrastructure, by also bringing the Indians steam engines, it is seldom looked back at as an equal relationship. The British Raj was divisive and pit Indians against one another, on the basis of religion; and also mistreated the laborers. The Indians were essentially slaves of the British rule and were working hard without any returns on their work. This, naturally, led to multiple mutinies; and prominent freedom fighters came to the forefront. Different ideologies of thought believed that there were different ways of gaining freedom; however, they all had one common goal - freedom. The British queen had asserted that the aim of the British was to help India progress - however, multiple problems arose without the consultation of Indian leaders. One important instance of this was when in the First World War, Britain launched an attack on Germany on behalf of India, even though India did not wish for that to happen; and millions of Indian soldiers were at the forefront of the British Indian Army during both the world wars - further fuelling the Indian resistance. Over a million Indian soldiers were killed in both the World Wars. People Also Ask questions about the history of India: What is the earliest period of Indian history?

Examples include the Indus Valley civilization, the Vedic Age, the Mauryan Empire, and the Gupta Empire. All of these civilizations contributed and utilized many advancements in the worlds of science, technology, art, and culture. Grades 9 - 12 Subjects World History, Archaeology, Anthropology ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ Loading ... Overview Starting around 2600 BCE, major ancient civilizations began developing in India. These civilizations had networks of trade and communication across organized cities, and the people of these civilizations contributed and utilized many advancements in the worlds of science, technology, art, and culture. Indus Valley Civilization The earliest known major civilization in ancient India was the Indus Valley civilization that became more organized around 2600 BCE. However, its development started earlier than that, with some evidence of cultural and technological developments going back to 5000 B.C.E. But by 2600 B.C.E., the Indus Valley civilization had planned cities with complex public work projects like a sewage and drainage system. Its people had a shared written language, which has still not been deciphered. They established and regulated trade with other civilizations, including Egypt and Mesopotamia . There were advances in technology like standardized systems of weights and the use of various crafts like metalworking. Despite its achievements, the Indus Valley civilization declined around 1900 B.C.E. Some experts believe that this was because of changes to the climate that made it harder to farm. There is evidence that people left the cities and spread out over large areas of land again. The Vedic Age The era that followed the Indus Valley civilization was the Vedic or Indo-Aryan Age from 1500 BCE to 500 BCE. During this time, Indian society was characterized by independent tribal kingdoms, so overall it was less structured, with its people less connected and unified. There were fewer technological advancements made during this time as well. But major changes in religion, particularly the beginning of Hinduism , made this a notable era in the history of Ancient India. As the Indus Valley civilization was declining, people from central Asia called Aryans were beginning to migrate to the area. Some scholars think that the migration of the Aryans contributed to the fall of the Indus Valley civilization through a series of violent invasions, while others think that they migrated largely peacefully. There are also modern-day Indians and others that reject the idea of Aryans having influence in the Indus Valley at all, arguing that new ideas and languages that were later attributed to the Aryans by white colonizers are actually indigenous. However, most scholars agree that Aryans came into the Indus Valley and took control at around the same time the Indus Valley civilization was breaking up. Though the Aryans were nomadic at the beginning of the era, they would later form tribal kingdoms throughout the Indus Valley. Therefore, the structure of society of this time was not urban as it had been during the Indus Valley civilization. The major contribution to Indian society to come out of the Vedic age is the early development of Hinduism. Hinduism is a collection of traditions and beliefs all centered around rebirth and karma , which says that a person’s behavior in one life will affect the next one. It is considered the oldest religion in the world that is still being practiced. Important early Hindu texts called the Veda were written during this time. The Veda explained a ritual system that is largely believed to come from the Indo-Aryans. This system also included belief in many gods, which became an aspect of Hinduism. As Hinduism has no official founder, and instead is based on many different rituals and writings, these texts would later form an important base of the religion. The Vedas were also the source of the caste system , which would have major influence on Indian society that continues today. Today, the caste system is a social hierarchy that relates to social status and perceived purity and determines someone’s social standing from birth. The caste system breaks society into five groups: the priests at the top, then the warriors, then the merchants and farmers, the laborers, and the Dalits, the so-called “untouchables,” or those who were perform menial tasks and were excluded from society. Though the caste system was originally based on occupations, because jobs were handed down from fathers to sons, the system became based on birth rather than chosen profession. Later during the Vedic age, other important Hindu religious texts like the Mahabharata and the Ramayana came from this period. End of Vedic Age and Transition The Vedic Age ended in the middle of the last millennium B.C.E when ancient India began to be organized into larger empires with networks of cities again. As the Vedic Age ended and the region transitioned into bigger empires again, trade, art, culture, and the sciences flourished. Some of the major religions that developed were Buddhism and Jainism . Buddhism was founded by Siddhartha Gautama, later known as the Buddha, in the 6th century B.C.E. It is a religion focused on achieving enlightenment, or a state of being completely at peace and wisdom, through meditation and learning. Jainism was founded by Vardhamana Mahavira, also in the 6th century BCE. Jainism focuses on non-violence and working towards an all-knowing state called moksha through causing as little harm to the world as possible. Both of these religions had some tenets of Hinduism, but rejected certain aspects of the Vedas and caste system. They were also part of a general societal upheaval that was happening at the time that challenged the social system of the Vedas and eventually fueled the growth of cities. An event that happened at the end of the Vedic Age that would influence the future indigenous civilizations was Alexander the Great’s making a campaign of conquest, which began in Greece and swept east until he reached India. Before Alexander, a Macedonian king, entered India, Persians were in control of large parts of Northern India. Alexander the Great made a campaign across it starting in 330 B.C.E. During his two-year quest, Alexander the Great brought aspects of Greek culture to India in the form of art and dress. However, Alexander died suddenly a few years after leaving India, leaving his lands vulnerable to conquest. He helped break up the Persians’ hold on Northern India, which would help later rulers expand their own indigenous empires. The Mauryan Empire The Mauryan Empire (322-185 BCE) rose after Alexander the Great took over areas formerly controlled by the Aryans and destabilized the region. This allowed the first ruler of the Mauryan Empire, Chandragupta, to take over land strategically. The Mauryan Empire was a very large empire that covered most of the Indian subcontinent at its peak. It is mostly known for spreading Buddhism through one of its most famous leaders, Ashoka, who was Chandragupta’s grandson. Acknowledged as one of the most well-known Indian leaders in history, Ashoka spread his control south and took over all of central India and some of southern India, before renouncing the violence that secured him his land and becoming a Buddhist. From there, Ashoka spread Buddhism to all of the areas he ruled, converting a large group of people. He did this through commissioning pillars inscribed with edicts based on Buddhism and his personal belief in non-violence and harmony. These pillars, many of which have been found in modern times, are also why modern people know about his reign and beliefs. After Ashoka’s death and without his strong leadership, the empire quickly fell, and again broke up into smaller kingdoms. The Gupta Empire The Gupta Empire began to rise in the late 4th century C.E., after the end of the Mauryan Empire. It was another time of significant achievements in literature, science, technology, and art. Some scholars refer to this time as the Classical Age of India because of the remarkable achievements of the time. The many advancements of the Gupta Empire happened in part because of a string of strong leaders that allowed its citizens to thrive. Chandragupta I (reigned 318-30 CE) is considered the first leader of the Gupta Empire. After inheriting a smaller piece of land, he extended his territory through marriage and conquering other lands. A later leader, Chandragupta II (375-415 CE), grew the empire to its widest. Under his rule, the empire was made up of two types of territories: one that was directly governed by the emperor, and ones that had their own kings who had pledged loyalty to the Gupta king. These areas paid taxes to the Gupta ruler but were otherwise free to manage their own lands, which made the conquered territories more open to Gupta rule for a time. The Gupta Empire had cultural and technological features that are still a part of Indian and world culture today. Multiple Hindu texts were incorporated together to form a cohesive religious canon , shaping Hinduism into the religion that we know it as today. The caste system also became stricter during this time. Scholars think that in earlier times, there was more social mobility between castes, but, during this era, they became more restrictive and prescriptive. There were also significant works of art made during this time. The relief sculptures at the Dashavatara Temple to the Hindu god Vishnu are a celebrated example of the refinement of Indian art. Fine arts such as sculpture and painting flourished. Frescos and statues made during this time often focused on the life of Buddha and were commissioned by the emperor as well as other elites. Significant works of poetry and drama were also written during this time. For example, the playwright Kalidasa wrote both poetry and drama, which are considered the apex of literature in Sanskrit, the sacred language of Hinduism. There were also significant advances in mathematics during this period. These included the concept of the number zero and the successful calculation of pi to the order of four decimal places. Mathematician Aryabhata made many astronomical discoveries and was able to calculate the length of the solar year. The fall of the Gupta empire started in the 6th century after a series of weak rulers left the lands vulnerable to conquest. Muslim invaders took control of the region piece by piece, broken up into smaller city-states, until the Islamic Mughal Empire in the 1500s C.E. united the region under a common ruler again. The Muslim faith was spread throughout India, though Hindus remain the majority. The last Mughal ruler was deposed by the British in 1858.
